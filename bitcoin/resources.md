title: Resources

There exists an almost endless list of essays, articles, books, podcasts, and
other content on Bitcoin and the topics it touches on. The resources listed
below are but a small selection which were particularly influential in my
thinking. I am grateful for all the people who shared their insights, past and
present.

I encourage everyone to start at the beginning, and read the 8 pages which
gave birth to Bitcoin:

- [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System][bitcoin-whitepaper] by Satoshi Nakamoto

[bitcoin-whitepaper]: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

### Books

Thanks to Bitcoin, my list of books to read gets longer and longer, way quicker
than I could ever read them. The books listed below are books I can highly
recommend. If a particular book is not listed here, it is probably because I
didn't get around to read it yet. I hope to update this list continually as my
reading progresses.


#### Bitcoin (non-technical)

Books about Bitcoin which can be read by anyone, no special background Knowledge
or education required.  I consider *The Bitcoin Standard* required reading for
anyone interested in Bitcoin.

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="bitcoin-standard" alt="The Bitcoin Standard: The
Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking" %}
{% include book.html name="internet-of-money-vol1" %}
{% include book.html name="internet-of-money-vol2" %}
{% include book.html name="inventing-bitcoin" %}
<!-- {% include book.html name="bitcoin-money" %} -->
</ul>

#### Bitcoin (technical)

If you would like to dig deeper or get your hands dirty with programming, these
books are for you. Technical knowledge and skills in computer science,
programming, and/or mathematics are beneficial.

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="mastering-bitcoin" %}
{% include book.html name="programming-bitcoin" %}
{% include book.html name="grokking-bitcoin" %}
</ul>

#### Economics

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="economics-in-one-lesson" %}
{% include book.html name="human-action" %}
{% include book.html name="creature-from-jekyll-island" %}
{% include book.html name="end-the-fed" %}
</ul>

#### Central Banking

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="ethics-of-money-production" %}
{% include book.html name="creature-from-jekyll-island" %}
{% include book.html name="end-the-fed" %}
</ul>

#### Money

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="ethics-of-money-production" %}
{% include book.html name="creature-from-jekyll-island" %}
{% include book.html name="end-the-fed" %}
</ul>

#### Internet

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="the-innovators" %}
{% include book.html name="without-their-permission" %}
{% include book.html name="filter-bubble" %}
</ul>

#### Exponential Technologies

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="singularity-is-near" %}
{% include book.html name="life-3.0" %}
{% include book.html name="homo-deus" %}
{% include book.html name="exponential-organizations" %}
</ul>


<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="indistinguishable-from-magic" %}
{% include book.html name="abundance" %}
{% include book.html name="who-owns-the-future" %}
</ul>

#### Cypherpunks


<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="homo-deus" %}
{% include book.html name="homo-deus" %}
</ul>

#### Software and Programming

Bitcoin is free, libre open-source software. It is free as in freedom, free as
in free speech. Understanding what this means and why free software exists is
essential to understanding Bitcoin.

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="free-software-free-society" %}
{% include book.html name="cathedral-and-bazaar" %}
{% include book.html name="art-of-unix-programming" %}
{% include book.html name="pragmatic-programmer" %}
</ul>

I would argue that the ethos of GNU and UNIX programming are important corner
stones for Bitcoin. Further, Bitcoin is a pragmatic piece of software, which is
why I consider *The Pragmatic Programmer* a great book for anyone who wishes to
hack away on Bitcoin.

#### Computation and Complexity Theory

While Bitcoin is in the business of verification and not computation, knowing
the limits of what computers can do and what future computers might be able to
do can be beneficial to better understand some parts of Bitcoin. I highly
recommend *Gödel, Escher, Bach* because it is a deeply fascinating and beautiful
book.

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="goedel-escher-bach" %}
{% include book.html name="quantum-computing-since-democritus" %}
{% include book.html name="new-kind-of-science" %}
</ul>

*Quantum Computing Since Democritus* is quite dense, but it is also quite
entertaining at times. The first couple of chapters stay in the non-quantum
world of computing and might help to understand why breaking Bitcoin's security
is so hard. *A new Kind of Science* is certainly not for everyone, but parts of
it are quite interesting.

#### Work

Decentralized networks like Bitcoin, and the internet before it, change the way
people interact and work with each other. People who work on or create content
for Bitcoin are located all over the world, thus regular approaches to work
might not produce the best results. I found the following books to hit a certain
nerve, speaking as someone who has stepped outside of the regular way of working
on things.

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="crazy-at-work" %}
{% include book.html name="war-of-art" %}
{% include book.html name="remote" %}
</ul>

### Podcasts

One of the best ways to educate yourself on Bitcoin is by listening to the
smartest people in the space. Luckily, we are living in the golden age of
podcasts, and many great conversations are "open source" so to speak.
Disclosure: I was a guest on some of these podcasts. Links to those specific
episodes can be found [here][interviews].

[interviews]: {{ '/bitcoin/interviews' | absolute_url }}

I consider the following podcasts the best in the space:

- [Tales From The Crypt][tftc] by Marty Bent with RHR co-host Matt Odell
- [Noded][noded] by Pierre Rochard and Michael Goldstein
- [Stephan Livera Podcast][slp] by Stephan Livera
- [What Bitcoin Did][wbd] by Peter McCormack

[tftc]: https://tftc.io/tales-from-the-crypt/
[noded]: https://noded.org/
[slp]: https://stephanlivera.com/
[wbd]: https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/

Although I try to listen to every Bitcoin podcast under the sun, it is simply an
unsurmountable feat due to the sheer volume of content. The following podcasts
are excellent as well:

- [The Cryptoconomy][cryptoconomy] by Guy Swann
- [Bitcoin Echo Chamber][bec] by Heavily Armed Clown
- [Citizen Bitcoin][cb] by Brady
- [Crypto Voices][cv] by Matthew Mežinskis and Fernando Ulrich
- [The Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast][bkp] by Trace Mayer
- [Contrarian Island][ci] by MD
- [Crypto & Grill][cag] by CryptoDantes and StigofthePump

[bkp]: https://www.bitcoin.kn/about/
[cryptoconomy]: https://cryptoconomy.life/
[bec]: https://bitcoinechochamber.com/
[cb]: https://citizenbitcoin.world/
[ci]: https://contrarianisland.com
[cag]: https://twitter.com/cryptoandgrill
[cv]: https://cryptovoices.com/

The line between the best and the rest is quite arbitrary, but I felt like one
very long list might not be as useful as separate lists, however arbitrary the
distinction. I enjoy or have enjoyed the these podcasts as well:

- [Let's Talk Bitcoin][ltb] with Adam B. Levine, Andreas Antonopoulos, Stephanie Murphy and Jonathan Mohan
- [Reckless Review][rr] by Udi Wertheimer and Lawrence Nahum
- [Bitcoin and...][ba] by @bennd77
- [Fun With Crypto][fwc] by @Coinicarus
- [Bottomshelf Bitcoin][bsb] by Josh Humphrey

### Podcast episodes

Some "evergreen" episodes were recorded in the last couple of years. Again, this
is a personal selection so it is biased towards certain guests and topics. If
there is an episode missing that you consider to be one of the best, feel free
to [reach out to me][contact] and shill me said episode.

### Selected Articles

Many amazing articles have been written about Bitcoin. I am aware that trying to
link to all of them is futile, but I want to make an effort and at least
highlight some of them. I highly recommend the [literature listed][sni] at the
Nakamoto Institute, the selection of [articles read][guy-episodes] by
Guy Swann, and the [writings collected][brh-writings] by Adam Taché.

One of the best articles to read if you are new to Bitcoin is *The Bullish Case
for Bitcoin*, which outlines why there are very good reasons to be optimistic
about Bitcoin's future.

### Wikis and Guides

There are many great articles written by contributors of the *Bitcoin Wiki*. If you want to know more about a specific topic, the Bitcoin Wiki is a great resource. The *Libbitcoin Wiki* has an amazing list of fallacies, and some great explanations of Bitcoin's properties and principles. If you want to start hacking on Bitcoin you might want to check out the *Bitcoin Developer Guide*.
