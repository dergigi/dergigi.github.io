There exists an almost endless list of essays, articles, books, podcasts, and
other content on Bitcoin and the topics it touches on. The resources listed
below are but a small selection which were particularly influential in my
thinking. I am grateful for all the people who shared their insights, past and
present.

I encourage everyone to start at the beginning, and read the 8 pages which
gave birth to Bitcoin:

- [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System][bitcoin-whitepaper] by Satoshi Nakamoto

### Books

Thanks to Bitcoin, my list of books to read gets longer and longer, way quicker than I could
ever read them. The books listed below are books I can highly recommend. If a
particular book is not listed here, it is probably because I didn't get around
to read it yet. I aim to update this list continually.


#### Bitcoin (non-technical)

Books about Bitcoin which can be read by anyone, no special background Knowledge
or education required.  I consider *The Bitcoin Standard* required reading for
anyone interested in Bitcoin.

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="bitcoin-standard" alt="The Bitcoin Standard: The
Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking" %}
{% include book.html name="internet-of-money-vol1" %}
{% include book.html name="internet-of-money-vol2" %}
{% include book.html name="inventing-bitcoin" %}
<!-- {% include book.html name="bitcoin-money" %} -->
</ul>

#### Bitcoin (technical)

If you would like to dig deeper or get your hands dirty with programming, these
books are for you. Technical knowledge and skills in computer science,
programming, and/or mathematics are beneficial.

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="mastering-bitcoin" %}
{% include book.html name="programming-bitcoin" %}
{% include book.html name="grokking-bitcoin" %}
</ul>

#### Computation and Complexity Theory

While Bitcoin is in the business of verification and not computation, knowing
the limits of what computers can do and what future computers might be able to
do can be beneficial to better understand some parts of Bitcoin. I highly
recommend *Gödel, Escher, Bach* because it is a deeply fascinating and beautiful
book.

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="goedel-escher-bach" %}
{% include book.html name="quantum-computing-since-democritus" %}
{% include book.html name="new-kind-of-science" %}
</ul>

*Quantum Computing Since Democritus* is quite dense, but it is also quite
entertaining at times. The first couple of chapters stay in the non-quantum
world of computing and might help to understand why breaking Bitcoin's security
is so hard. *A new Kind of Science* is certainly not for everyone, but parts of
it are quite interesting.

#### Software and Programming

Bitcoin is free, libre open-source software. It is free as in freedom, free as
in free speech. Understanding what this means and why free software exists is
essential to understanding Bitcoin.

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="free-software-free-society" %}
{% include book.html name="cathedral-and-bazaar" %}
{% include book.html name="art-of-unix-programming" %}
{% include book.html name="pragmatic-programmer" %}
</ul>

I would argue that the ethos of GNU and UNIX programming are important corner
stones for Bitcoin. Further, Bitcoin is a pragmatic piece of software, which is
why I consider *The Pragmatic Programmer* a great book for anyone who wishes to
hack away on Bitcoin.

#### Economics and Central Banking

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="economics-in-one-lesson" %}
{% include book.html name="ethics-of-money-production" %}
{% include book.html name="creature-from-jekyll-island" %}
{% include book.html name="end-the-fed" %}
</ul>

#### Work

Decentralized networks like Bitcoin, and the internet before it, change the way
people interact and work with each other. People who work on or create content
for Bitcoin are located all over the world, thus regular approaches to work
might not produce the best results. I found the following books to hit a certain
nerve, speaking as someone who has stepped outside of the regular way of working
on things.

<ul class="books">
{% include book.html name="crazy-at-work" %}
{% include book.html name="war-of-art" %}
{% include book.html name="remote" %}
</ul>

### Podcasts

One of the best ways to educate yourself on Bitcoin is by listening to the
smartest people in the space. Luckily, we are living in the golden age of
podcasts, and many great conversations are "open source" so to speak.

I consider the following podcasts the best in the space:

- [Tales From The Crypt][tftc] by Marty Bent with RHR co-host Matt Odell
- [Noded][noded] by Pierre Rochard and Michael Goldstein
- [Stephan Livera Podcast][slp] by Stephan Livera
- [What Bitcoin Did][wbd] by Peter McCormack

[noded]: https://noded.org/
[slp]: https://stephanlivera.com/
[wbd]: https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/

Although I try to listen to every Bitcoin podcast under the sun, it is simply an
unsurmountable feat due to the sheer volume of content. The following podcasts
are excellent as well:

- [The Cryptoconomy][cryptoconomy] by Guy Swann
- [Bitcoin Echo Chamber][bec] by Heavily Armed Clown
- [Citizen Bitcoin][cb] by Brady
- [Crypto Voices][cv] by Matthew Mežinskis and Fernando Ulrich
- [The Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast][bkp] by Trace Mayer
- [Contrarian Island][ci] by MD
- [Crypto & Grill][cag] by CryptoDantes and StigofthePump

[cb]: https://citizenbitcoin.world/
[ci]: https://contrarianisland.com
[cag]: https://twitter.com/cryptoandgrill
[cv]: https://cryptovoices.com/

The line between the best and the rest is quite arbitrary, but I felt like one
very long list might not be as useful as separate lists, however arbitrary the
distinction. I enjoy or have enjoyed the these podcasts as well:

- [Let's Talk Bitcoin][ltb] with Adam B. Levine, Andreas Antonopoulos, Stephanie Murphy and Jonathan Mohan
- [Reckless Review][rr] by Udi Wertheimer and Lawrence Nahum
- [Bitcoin and...][ba] by @bennd77
