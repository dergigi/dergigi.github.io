There exists an almost endless list of content, books and essays on Bitcoin and
the topics it touches on. The resources listed below are but a small selection
which were particularly influential in my thinking. I am grateful for all the
people who shared their insights, past and present.

## Curations

There are other, more complete curations of Bitcoin content and resources. If
you are looking for longer, more varied lists, the following got you covered:

- [Bitcoin Literature][sni] by the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute
- [Learning Resources][bitcoin-only] by Bitcoin Only
- [Bitcoin Information & Resources][lopp] by Jameson Lopp

### Books

Thanks to Bitcoin, my list of books to read gets longer way quicker than I could
ever read them. The books listed below are books I can highly recommend. If a
particular book is not listed here, it is probably because I didn't get around
to read it yet.

### Podcasts

One of the best ways to educate yourself on Bitcoin is listening in on
conversations of other people. We are living in the golden age of podcasts, and
although I try to listen to every Bitcoin podcast under the sun it is simply an
unsurmountable feat.

I consider the following podcasts the best in the space:

- [Tales From The Crypt][tftc] by Marty Bent with RHR co-host Matt Odell
- [Noded][noded] by Pierre Rochard and Michael Goldstein
- [Stephan Livera Podcast][slp] by Stephan Livera
- [What Bitcoin Did][wbd] by Peter McCormack

The line between the best and the rest is quite arbitrary, but I felt like one
very long list might not be as useful as separate semi-sorted lists. While the
following podcasts  are excellent as well, they are either not as established or
not for everyone:

- [The Cryptoconomy][cryptoconomy] by Guy
- [Bitcoin Echo Chamber][bec] by Heavily Armed Clown
- [Citizen Bitcoin][cb] by Brady
- [Contrarian Island][ci] by MD
- [Crypto & Grill][cag] by CryptoDantes and StigofthePump
- Reckless Review
- Bitcoin and...
- Fun With Crypto
