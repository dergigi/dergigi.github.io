Nic Carter, in an homage to Thomas Nagel's treatment of the same
question [in regards to a bat], wrote an excellent piece which discusses
the following question: [What is it like to be a bitcoin?] He
brilliantly shows that open, public blockchains in general, and Bitcoin
in particular, suffer from the same conundrum as the [Ship of
Theseus]: which Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin?

It seems like the advancement of technology keeps forcing us to take
these philosophical questions seriously. Sooner or later, self-driving
cars will be faced with real-world versions of the [trolley problem],
forcing them to make ethical decisions about whose lives do matter and
whose do not.

Cryptocurrencies, especially since the first contentious hard-fork,
force us to think about and agree upon the metaphysics of identity.
Interestingly, the two biggest examples we have so far have lead to two
different answers. On August 1, 2017, Bitcoin split into two camps. The
market decided that the unaltered chain is the original Bitcoin. One
year earlier, on October 25, 2016, Ethereum split into two camps. The
market decided that the *altered* chain is the original Ethereum.

If properly decentralized, the questions posed by the *Ship of Theseus*
will have to be answered in perpetuity for as long as these networks of
value-transfer exist.

Bitcoin taught me that decentralization contradicts identity.
