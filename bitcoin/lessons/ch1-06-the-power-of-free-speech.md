Bitcoin is an idea. An idea which, in its current form, is the
manifestation of a machinery purely powered by text. Every aspect of
Bitcoin is text: The whitepaper is text. The software which is run by
its nodes is text. The ledger is text. Transactions are text. Public and
private keys are text. Every aspect of Bitcoin is text, and thus
equivalent to speech.

Although the final battle of the [Crypto Wars] has not been fought yet,
it will be very difficult to criminalize an idea, let alone an idea
which is based on the exchange of text messages. Every time a government
tries to outlaw text or speech, we slip down a path of absurdity which
inevitably leads to abominations like [illegal numbers] and [illegal
primes].

As long as there is a part of the world where speech is free as in
*freedom*, Bitcoin is unstoppable.

Bitcoin taught me that in a free society, free speech and free software
are unstoppable.
