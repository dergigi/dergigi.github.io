Some questions have easy answers. "What have you learned from Bitcoin?"
isn't one of them. After trying to answer this question in a short
tweet, and failing miserably, I realized that the things I've
learned are far too numerous to answer quickly, if at all. I also
realized that any set of answers to this question will be different for
everyone --- a reflection of the very personal journey through the
wonderful world of Bitcoin. Hence, the subtitle of this series is *What
I've Learned From Bitcoin*, with which I want to acknowledge the
inherent personal bias of answering a question like this.

As hinted above, attempting to answer this question fully is a fool's
errand, thus my answers will always be incomplete. I would like to
lessen this shortcoming by inviting you, dear reader, to share your own
answers to [this question]:

Bitcoin is indeed a game disguised. It is akin to a trapdoor, a gateway
to a different world. A world much stranger than I would have ever
imagined it to be. A world which takes your assumptions and shatters
them into a thousand tiny pieces, again and again. Stick around for long
enough, and Bitcoin will completely change your worldview.
