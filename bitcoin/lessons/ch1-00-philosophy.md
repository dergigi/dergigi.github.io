Looking at Bitcoin superficially, one might conclude that it is slow, wasteful,
unnecessarily redundant, and overly paranoid. Looking at Bitcoin inquisitively,
one might find out that things are not always as they seem.

Bitcoin has a way of taking your assumptions and turning them on their heads.
After a while, just when you were about to get comfortable with your new set of
assumptions, Bitcoin will smash through a wall and shatter your assumptions
again.

The following lessons are about some of the conceptual and philosophical
assumptions which Bitcoin touches: identity, locality, scarcity, immutability,
code, speech, and more.

I hope that you will find the world of Bitcoin as educational, fascinating and
entertaining as I did and still do. In any case, hop on and enjoy the ride.
Let's follow the white rabbit and see how deep this rabbit hole goes.
