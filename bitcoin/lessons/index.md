These lessons were first published as a three-part article series titled
[What I've Learned From Bitcoin][I]. Grouped into bundles of seven, each article
explores some of the teachings of Bitcoin and the lessons I learned. The lessons
are still roughly grouped into three parts based on the original articles:
[philosophy][Chapter 1], [economy][Chapter 2], and [technology][Chapter 3].

[Chapter 3]: {{ '/bitcoin/lessons/ch3-00-technology' | absolute_url }}
