Falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole is a strange experience. You will learn
about all kinds of topics, ranging from mathematics and physics to history,
money, economics, politics and game theory. The list of topics is almost
endless, as is the list of relevant literature.

The following is an account of my own journey down the rabbit hole. A
journey which is still ongoing, and if my assumptions are correct, will
continue for quite a while.

These lessons were first published as a three-part article series titled
[What I've Learned From Bitcoin][I]. Grouped into bundles of seven, each article
explores some of the teachings of Bitcoin and the lessons I learned. The lessons
are still roughly grouped into three parts based on the original articles:
[philosophy][Chapter 1], [economy][Chapter 2], and [technology][Chapter 3].
