The following lessons are, obviously, about Bitcoin. However, while some of the
inner workings of Bitcoin are explained, what follows is not an explanation of
how Bitcoin works or what it is. It is a place to explore some of the things
Bitcoin touches: philosophical questions, economic realities, and technological
innovations.

There certainly are better points of entry if you have never heard about Bitcoin
before. Great books have been written, videos have been made, courses have been
created. However, there is no "right way" to learn about Bitcoin. So if you are
new and ended up here, that's fine! I hope some of these lessons will be useful
to you.

The 21 lessons are structured in bundles of seven, resulting in three chapters.
Each chapter is looking at Bitcoin through a different lens, extracting what
lessons can be learned by looking at this strange network from a different
angle.

[Chapter 1][chapter1] explores the philosophical teachings of Bitcoin. The
interplay of immutability and change, the concept of true scarcity, Bitcoin's
immaculate conception, the problem of identity, the contradiction of replication
and locality, the power of free speech, and the limits of knowledge.

[Chapter 2][chapter2] explores the economic teachings of Bitcoin. Lessons about
financial ignorance, inflation, value, money and the history of money,
fractional reserve banking, and how Bitcoin is re-introducing sound money in a
sly, roundabout way.

[Chapter 3][chapter3] explores some of the lessons learned by examining the
technology of Bitcoin.  Why there is strength in numbers, reflections on trust,
why telling time takes work, how moving slowly and not breaking things is a
feature and not a bug, what Bitcoin's creation can tell us about privacy, why
cypherpunks write code (and not laws), and what metaphors might be useful to
explore Bitcoin's future.

Even though some prior knowledge about Bitcoin is beneficial, I hope that these
lessons can be digested by any curious reader. Each lesson stands on its own and
can be read independently. While some domain-specific vocabulary is used, I did
my best to shy away from technical jargon and everything else that makes things
more difficult rather than easier to understand.

My goal in writing this is not to convince you of anything. My goal is to make
you think, and show you that there is way more to Bitcoin than meets the eye. I
can't even tell you what Bitcoin is or what Bitcoin will teach you. *You* will
have to find that out for yourself.
