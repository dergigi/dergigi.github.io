The following lessons are, obviously, about Bitcoin. However, while some of the
inner workings of Bitcoin are explained, what follows is not an explanation of
how Bitcoin works or what it is. It is a place to explore some of the things
Bitcoin touches: philosophical questions, economic realities, and technological
innovations.

There are probably better points of entry if you have never heard about Bitcoin
before. Great books have been written, videos have been made, courses have been
created. However, there is no "right way" to learn about Bitcoin. So if you are
new and ended up here, that's fine! I hope some of these lessons will be useful
to you.

The 21 lessons are structured in bundles of seven, resulting in three chapters.
Each chapter is looking at Bitcoin through a different lens, extracting what
lessons can be learned by looking at this strange network from a different
angle.

[Chapter 1][chapter1] explores the philosophical teachings of Bitcoin. The
interplay of immutability and change, the concept of true scarcity, Bitcoin's
immaculate conception, the problem of identity, the contradiction of replication
and locality, the power of free speech, and the limits of knowledge.

[Chapter 2][chapter2] explores the economic teachings of Bitcoin. Lessons about
financial ignorance, inflation, value, money and the history of money,
fractional reserve banking, and how Bitcoin is re-introducing sound money in a
sly, roundabout way.

[Chapter 3][chapter3] explores some of the lessons learned by examining the
technology of Bitcoin.  Why there is strength in numbers, reflections on trust,
why telling time takes work, how moving slowly and not breaking things is a
feature and not a bug, what Bitcoin's creation can tell us about privacy, why
cypherpunks write code (and not laws), and what metaphors might be useful to
explore Bitcoin's future.

In October 2010, Arjun Balaji asked the innocuous question, [*What have you
learned from Bitcoin?*][this question] After trying to answer this question in a
short tweet, and failing miserably, I realized that the things I've learned are
far too numerous to answer quickly, if at all. I also realized that any set of
answers to this question will be different for everyone --- a reflection of the
very personal journey through the wonderful world of Bitcoin. Hence, the
subtitle is *What I've Learned From Falling Down The Bitcoin Rabbit Hole*, with
which I want to acknowledge the inherent personal bias of answering a question
like this.

Attempting to answer this question fully is a fool's errand, thus my answers
will always be incomplete.
