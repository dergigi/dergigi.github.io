The following lessons are extracted from three long-form articles I have written
over the course of several months. My journey down the rabbit hole started long
before I started writing about Bitcoin. And since these lessons are a reflection
of my personal experience and my memory isn't perfect, I don't claim that they
are universal or complete. I hope, however, that they are instructive. Or at
least interesting at times.

Falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole is a strange experience. It is quite
fascinating where simple questions like "What is money?" can lead you. The
modern equivalent is, of course, the following: "What is Bitcoin?" Exploring
this question with curiosity will lead you to strange places and even stranger
conclusions.

Bitcoin touches everything from cryptography (based in mathematics and physics)
to economics, politics, game theory, computer science, and so much more. You
will learn about money and its history, micro- and macro-economics, distributed
and centralized systems, as well as Schelling points and points on elliptic
curves. The list of topics is almost endless, as is the list of relevant
literature.

What follows is an account of my own journey down the rabbit hole. A journey
which is still ongoing, which is why these lessons might be updated from time to
time. I plan to expand on some topics in more detail, as I have done by writing
about [Bitcoin's Gravity][gravity] which expands on the main idea in [Lesson
1][lesson1].

First published as a three-part article series titled [“What I’ve Learned From
Bitcoin,”][I] the lessons are still roughly grouped into three chapters:
philosophy, economics, and technology. Each chapter contains seven lessons
learned, resulting in the following 21:

Alright, enough about how all this came to be. Start with [Chapter I][chapter1]
if you are sequentialist. Or jump around if that's your thing. I don't judge.
The lessons are mostly independent chunks and the order doesn't really matter
too much. Also, don't despair if you are feeling lost. There is a link to the
[Table of Contents][toc] at the top and bottom of each page.

Have fun diving in! And if you find these lessons useful, or if you have other
comments or suggestions of any kind, [I'd love to hear from you][contact].

Safe journey,<br/>
