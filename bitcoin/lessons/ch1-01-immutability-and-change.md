Bitcoin is inherently hard to describe. It is a *new thing*, and any
attempt to draw a comparison to previous concepts --- be it by calling
it digital gold or the internet of money --- is bound to fall short of
the whole. Whatever your favorite analogy might be, two aspects of
Bitcoin are absolutely essential: decentralization and immutability.

One way to think about Bitcoin is as an [automated social contract]. The
software is just one piece of the puzzle, and hoping to change Bitcoin
by changing the software is an exercise in futility. One would have to
convince the rest of the network to adopt the changes, which is more a
psychological effort than a software engineering one.

The following might sound absurd at first, like so many other things in
this space, but I believe that it is profoundly true nonetheless: You
won't change Bitcoin, but Bitcoin will change you.

It took me a long time to realize the profundity of this. Since Bitcoin
is just software and all of it is open-source, you can simply change
things at will, right? Wrong. *Very* wrong. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin's
creator knew this all too well.

Many people have attempted to change Bitcoin's nature. So far all of
them have failed. While there is an endless sea of forks and altcoins,
the Bitcoin network still does its thing, just as it did when the first
node went online. The altcoins won't matter in the long run. The forks
will eventually starve to death. Bitcoin is what matters. As long as our
fundamental understanding of mathematics and/or physics doesn't change,
the Bitcoin honeybadger will continue to not care.

> <cite>[Ralph Merkle]</cite>

The heartbeat of the Bitcoin network will outlast all of ours.

Realizing the above changed me way more than the past blocks of the
Bitcoin blockchain ever will. It changed my time preference, my
understanding of economics, my political views, and so much more. Hell,
it is even [changing people's diets]. If all of this sounds crazy to
you, you're in good company. All of this is crazy, and yet it is
happening.

Bitcoin taught me that it won't change. I will.
