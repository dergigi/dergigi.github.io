The following lessons are extracted from three long-form articles I have written
over the course of several months. My journey down the rabbit hole started long
before I started writing about Bitcoin, and since these lessons are a reflection
of my personal experience, I don't claim them to be absolute nor complete. I
hope, however, that they are instructive or at least interesting at times.

Falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole is a strange experience. It is quite
fascinating how simple questions like "What is money?" can lead you if pursued
with curiosity. In today's time, the question to ask is "What is Bitcoin?" and
the places (and conclusions) this question will lead you to are strange indeed.

If you dig deep enough you will inevitably learn about a plethora of subjects.
Bitcoin touches everything from cryptography (based in mathematics and physics)
to economics, politics, game theory, computer science, and so much more. You
will learn about money and its history, micro- and macro-economics, distributed
and centralized systems, elliptic-curve and Schelling points, and why things
have value in the first place. The list of topics is almost endless, as is the
list of relevant literature.

What follows is an account of my own journey down the rabbit hole. A journey
which is still ongoing, which is why these lessons might be updated from time to
time. I plan to expand on some topics in more detail, as I have done by writing
about [Bitcoin's Gravity][gravity] which expands on the main idea in [Lesson
1][lesson1].

The 21 lessons were first published as a three-part article series titled ["What
Iâ€™ve Learned From Bitcoin"][I] and are still roughly grouped into three chapters
based on the original articles: philosophy, economy, and technology.

Alright, enough about how all this came to be. Start with [Chapter I][chapter1]
if you are sequentialist. Or jump around if that's your thing. I don't judge.
The lessons are mostly independent chunks and the order doesn't really matter
too much. Also, don't despair if you are feeling lost. There is a link to the
[Table of Contents][toc] at the bottom of each page. And at the top.

Have fun diving in! And if you find these lessons useful, or if you have other
comments or suggestions of any kind, [I'd love to hear from you][contact].

Safe journey,<br/>
