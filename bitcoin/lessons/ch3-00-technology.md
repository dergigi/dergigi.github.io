Golden keys, clocks which only work by chance, races to solve strange riddles,
and builders that don't have faces or names. What sounds like fairy tales from
Wonderland is daily business in the world of Bitcoin.

As we explored in [Chapter 2][chapter2], large parts of the current financial
system are systematically broken. Like Alice, we can only hope to manage better
this time. But, thanks to a pseudonymous inventor, we have incredibly
sophisticated technology to support us this time around: Bitcoin.

Solving problems in a radically decentralized and adversarial environment
requires unique solutions. What would otherwise be trivial problems to solve
are everything but in this strange world of nodes. Bitcoin relies on strong
cryptography for most solutions, at least if looked at through the lens of
technology. Just how strong this cryptography is will be explored in one of the
following lessons.

Cryptography is what Bitcoin uses to remove trust in authorities. Instead of
relying on centralized institutions, the system relies on the final authority of
our universe: physics. Some grains of trust still remain, however. We will
examine these grains in the second lesson of this chapter.

{% include lesson-list.html chapter="3"%}

The last couple of lessons explore the ethos of technological development in
Bitcoin, which is arguably as important as the technology itself. Bitcoin is not
the next shiny app on your phone. It is the foundation of a new economic
reality, which is why Bitcoin should be treated as nuclear-grade financial
software.

Where are we in this financial, societal, and technological revolution? Networks
and technologies of the past may serve as metaphors for Bitcoins future, which
are explored in the last lesson of this chapter.

Once more, strap in and enjoy the ride. Like all exponential technologies, we
are about to go parabolic.
