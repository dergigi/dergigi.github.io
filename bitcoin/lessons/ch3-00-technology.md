Golden keys, clocks which only work by chance, races to solve strange riddles,
builders that don't have faces or names. What sounds like fairy tales from
Wonderland is daily business in the world of Bitcoin.

As we explored in [Chapter 2][chapter2], large parts of the current financial
system are systematically broken. Like Alice, we can only hope to manage better
this time. But, thanks to a pseudonymous inventor, we have incredibly
sophisticated technology to support us this time around: Bitcoin.

Solving problems in a radically decentralized and adversarial environment
requires unique solutions to problems which would otherwise be trivial. Bitcoin
relies on strong cryptography to solve these problems, at least if looked at
through the lens of technology. Just how strong this cryptography is will be
explored in one of the following lessons.

Cryptography is what Bitcoin uses to do away with trust in institutions. Instead
of relying on centralized authorities, the system relies on the central
authority of our universe: mathematics and physics. Some grains of trust still
remain, however. We will examine these grains in the second lesson of this
chapter.

The last couple of lessons explore the ethos of technological development in
Bitcoin, which is arguably as important as the technology itself. Bitcoin is not
the next shiny app on your phone. It is the foundation of a new economic
reality, which is why Bitcoin should be treated as nuclear-reactor grade
financial software.

Where are we in this financial/societal/technological revolution? Networks and
technologies of the past may serve as metaphors for Bitcoins future, which are
explored in the last lesson of this chapter.

Again, strap in and enjoy the ride. Like all exponential technologies, we are
about to go parabolic.
