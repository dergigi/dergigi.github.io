What is Bitcoin? The many answers to this question are as interesting as they
are varied. Bitcoin is both a social and a monetary phenomenon, but it is also a
technological one. The intersection of many disciplines is what makes Bitcoin
endlessly fascinating.

Like many others, I began to stumble down this strange rabbit hole a while ago.
Even though the following lessons are the final seven, one could easily expand
this list of lessons to 21 dozens. Maybe even 21 million. In any case, I am
still stumbling down the rabbit hole with no end in sight, and I invite you to
stumble along with me.

This is the third chapter of a personal journey. Again, I am indebted to
[Arjun Balaji] who asked the following on Twitter: *"What have you
learned from Bitcoin?"* It is this question which has led me to write
these lessons down and outline some of the things I've learned.

[Chapter I][chapter1] explored what I've learned from Bitcoin when seen through a
philosophical lens: the interplay of immutability and change, copying
and scarcity, Bitcoin's origin story and identity, locality in a world
of replication, money as free speech, and the limits of knowledge.

[Chapter II][chapter2] discussed some of the economic teachings of Bitcoin: the
concept of value, (sound) money and its history, inflation, and some
aspects of "modern" banking like fractional reserve banking.

[Chapter III][chapter3] will explore seven lessons I have learned from examining
Bitcoin through the lens of technology. As in the previous parts, I will
only be able to scratch the surface. Bitcoin is an expanding universe,
evolving and improving every day. Whole books can be and have been
written on small, specific parts of this cosmos. And just like in our
own universe, the expansion seems to be accelerating.
