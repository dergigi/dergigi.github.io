Golden keys, clocks which only work by chance, races to solve strange riddles,
builders that don't have faces or names. What sounds like fairy tales from
Wonderland is daily business in the world of Bitcoin.

As we explored in [Chapter 2][chapter2], large parts of the current financial
system are systematically broken. Like Alice, we can only hope to manage better
this time. But, thanks to a pseudonymous inventor, we have incredibly
sophisticated technology to support us in our endeavor this time around:
Bitcoin.

While Bitcoin is both a social and a monetary phenomenon, it is also a
technological one. Again, I would argue that the intersection of many
disciplines is what makes Bitcoin so special. However, I would also argue that
Bitcoinâ€™s technology is endlessly fascinating in its own right.

Solving problems in a radically decentralized and adversarial environment
requires unique solutions to problems which would otherwise be trivial. Bitcoin
relies on strong cryptography to solve these problems, at least if looked at
through the lens of technology. Just how strong this cryptography is will be
explored in one of the following lessons.

Bitcoin replaces trust in institutions with cryptographic proof, relying on the
authority of physics instead of centralized authorities. What it means to trust
software is explored in more details in the second lessons of this chapter.

The last couple of lessons explore the ethos of technological development in
Bitcoin, which is arguably as important as the technology itself. Bitcoin is not
the next shiny app on your phone. It is the foundation of a new economic
reality, which is why Bitcoin should be treated as nuclear-reactor grade
financial software.

Where are we in this financial/societal/technological revolution? Networks and
technologies of the past may serve as metaphors for Bitcoins future, which are
explored in the last lesson of this chapter.

Again, strap in and enjoy the ride. Like all exponential technologies, we are
about to go parabolic.
