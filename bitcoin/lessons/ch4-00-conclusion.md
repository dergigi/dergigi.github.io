TODO: Conclusive conclusion

<!-- Chapter I -->
Bitcoin is a child of the internet. Even though it requires computers to
function efficiently, computer science is not sufficient to understand
it. The implications of this new technology are far-reaching. Bitcoin is
not only borderless but also boundaryless in respect to academic
disciplines.

In the [first chapter][chapter1] I tried to outline some
of the philosophical implications of this fascinating machinery. In part
two I will try to discuss what Bitcoin taught me about economics. Part
three will conclude this series to show what I, a technologist, have
learned from the tech perspective by stumbling into Bitcoin.

As mentioned above, I think that any answer to the question *"What have
you learned from Bitcoin?"* will always be incomplete. The systems are
too dynamic, the space moving too fast, and the topics too numerous.
Politics, game theory, monetary history, network theory, finance,
cryptography, information theory, censorship, law and regulation, human
organization, psychology --- all these and more are areas of expertise
which might help to grasp what Bitcoin is.

<!-- Chapter II -->
As we leave the “blockchain not bitcoin” days behind us, most people start
to realize that there is not a single invention which encapsulates the
genius of Bitcoin. It is the combination of multiple, previously unrelated
pieces, glued together by game theoretical incentives, which make up the
revolution that is Bitcoin.

For me, the economic teachings of Bitcoin are as fascinating as the
philosophical ones examined in [part one][I]. Being a technophile, I can’t wait
to tell you what Bitcoin taught me about technology in the third and final
part of this series.

As mentioned before, I think that any answer to the question “What have you
learned from Bitcoin?” will always be incomplete. The symbiosis of the
two living systems examined here — Bitcoin and economics — is too intertwined
and evolving too fast to ever be fully understood by a single person.

> “I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take
the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can’t take it violently
out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way
introduce something that they can’t stop.”
> <cite>[Friedrich Hayek][sly roundabout way]</cite>

Learning these lessons enabled me to finally understand what Hayek meant by
the above. I believe that Bitcoin is the sly, roundabout way to re-introduce
sound money to the world. Thanks to the economic teachings of Bitcoin I
learned what good money is and that having it is possible.

<!-- Chapter III -->
Technology is all about the application of scientific knowledge to solve
problems in the real world. Every technology has to make tradeoffs in
terms of efficiency, cost, security, and many other properties. Just
like there is no perfect solution to deriving a square from a circle,
any solution to the problems which Bitcoin tries to solve will always be
imperfect as well.

Da Vinci tried to solve the intractable problem of squaring a circle
with the *Vitruvian Man*, which places a human right at the center of
it. Bitcoin tries to solve the double spending problem with sovereign
individuals, which places humans behind each node, effectively removing
any concept of a center.

Bitcoin's headless nature shows us that seemingly simple concepts like
creating accounts and agreeing on time require creative solutions in
decentralized systems. It also shows that such systems can be
astonishingly antifragile. How do you best kill something if the best
point of attack is everywhere?

Even with all its quirks and seeming shortcomings, Bitcoin undoubtedly
works. It keeps producing blocks roughly every ten minutes and does so
beautifully. The longer Bitcoin continues to work, the more people will
opt-in to use it.

> "It's true that things are beautiful when they work. Art is function."
> <cite>[Giannina Braschi]</cite>

Bitcoin is growing exponentially, blurring the line between disciplines.
It isn't clear where the realm of pure technology ends and where another
realm begins. I tried to differentiate the [economic teachings of Bitcoin][II]
from the [philosophical][I] and the technological ones, which turned out
more difficult than expected.

Just like in biological systems, removing one part seems to affect the
whole. Maybe the most important lesson is that Bitcoin should be
examined holistically, from multiple angles, if one would like to have a
complete picture. Just like removing one part from Bitcoin destroys the
whole (*\*cough\** blockchain *\*cough\**), examining parts of Bitcoin
in isolation seems to taint the understanding of the whole system.

My journey continues, and as mentioned in part one, I think that any
answer to the question *"What have you learned from Bitcoin?"* will
always be incomplete. In any case, I've learned that the philosophy,
economics, and technology of Bitcoin interact in a complex feedback
loop, and I hope that these 21 lessons are just the beginning of what
I've learned from Bitcoin.
