Everyone loves a good origin story. The origin story of Bitcoin is a
fascinating one, and the details of it are more important than one might
think at first. Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? Was he one person or a group of
people? Was he a she? Time-traveling alien, or advanced AI? Outlandish
theories aside, we will probably never know. And this is important.

Satoshi chose to be anonymous. He planted the seed of Bitcoin. He stuck
around for long enough to make sure the network won't die in its
infancy. And then he vanished.

What might look like a weird anonymity stunt is actually crucial for a
truly decentralized system. No centralized control. No centralized
authority. No inventor. No-one to prosecute, torture, blackmail, or
extort. An immaculate conception of technology.

Since the birth of Bitcoin, thousands of other cryptocurrencies were
created. None of these clones share its origin story. If you want to
supersede Bitcoin, you will have to transcend its origin story. In a war
of ideas, narratives dictate survival.

Like gold in ancient times, Bitcoin might be considered a gift from the
gods. Unlike gold, Bitcoins origins are all too human. And this time, we
know who the gods of development and maintenance are: people all over
the world, anonymous or not.

Bitcoin taught me that narratives are important.
