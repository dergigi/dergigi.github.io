Over the millennia, humans have used a multitude of objects as money: cattle,
salt, shells, bones, pearls, stones, copper, bronze, silver, gold, and other
precious metals. While the list of historical monies is long, there is one trait
that all functioning monies share: scarcity. After all, if something is
extremely easy to find or produce, it isn't good money, or at least not for
long.

It isn't difficult to understand why money has to be scarce. Imagine what would
happen if everyone would have a StarTrek-style replicator: a small machine that
can create copies of any physical object out of thin air. People would, instead
of earning money by doing productive work for society, simply copy whatever is
used as money, enriching themselves in the process. Humans have figured out that
this doesn't work very well, which is why up to very recently, scarce or
hard-to-produce objects were used as money. No matter where you look—when it
comes to money— people all over the world ended up using something that wasn't
easy to find or produce. In other words, everyone figured out that money needs
to have _scarcity_.

Due to the happenstance of physics, geography, and biology, naturally occurring
objects differ in scarcity. Gold is more scarce than copper or bronze, seashells
are only scarce if you don't live near the sea, and cattle and salt are only
scarce if you don't figure out how to easily make more of them.[^fn-scarcity]

[^fn-scarcity]: While scarcity is a very important property of good money, it isn't the only quality that is required for something to be good money—as we have seen in [Chapter 4][4].

[4]: {{ '/4' | absolute_url }}

Digital goods don't share this property. They aren't scarce by nature, since the
marginal cost to replicate them is practically zero, as anyone who ever
copy-and-pasted something can attest to. For this reason, digital scarcity used
to be an oxymoron. If something is digital, it is just information, and
information can be easily copied.

While one could argue that digital scarcity did exist before Bitcoin, it was
always a matter of _scarcity by authority_, not scarcity by physical law. The
nature of digital goods necessitates that a central authority regulates
issuance, access, and management of said digital good. If access isn't
regulated, anyone can simply take the information that represents this digital
good and make copies of it (or, sometimes even more problematic: change it). It
doesn't matter if it is the bits and bytes that define the balance of your bank
account, the books in your Kindle, the movies in your Netflix library, the songs
in your Spotify playlists, or the items in your favorite video game. If access
isn't centrally controlled, people will change the balance of their bank
account, share copies of books and movies with others, copy and remix songs, and
modify in-game items to make them more powerful. Information wants to be free,
and as the unsinkable ships of _Pirate Bay_ and endless leaks and data breaches
clearly show, building a cage around information is anything but easy.

To get a better understanding of digital goods and their scarcity (or lack
thereof) we will take a look at the virtual worlds that first spawned them:
online games.

Centrally issued digital items and the virtual worlds that made use of them are
a great way to illustrate the difference between the real scarcity provided by
Bitcoin, and the fictitious scarcity dictated by the decree of trusted third
parties. As we shall see, virtual worlds can and do spawn real economies, but
when it comes to money, cyberspace isn't always fun and games.

### A Short History Of Virtual Economies

In-game economies are almost as old as networked gaming itself. In 1995, Julian
Dibbell published _MUD Money_[^fn-mud] Coins would appear randomly in these
online worlds, so if you stroll around for long enough you would, over time,
find enough money to pay for certain goods and services in these games. Randall
Farmer, a researcher at MIT who studied the emergence of virtual economies at
this time, describes how in a game called _Habitat_ "players could acquire [...]
funds by engaging in business, winning contests, finding buried treasure, and so
on." He details how players would get a certain amount of tokens every time they
log in, and how "they could spend their tokens on, among other things, various
items for sale in vending machines called _Vendroids_. There were also Pawn
Machines, which would buy objects back (at a discount, of course)."

[^fn-mud]: See https://web.archive.org/web/20070816070650/http://www.juliandibbell.com/texts/mudmoney.html, which describes how money was introduced in Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs).

{% include image.html name="adventure-mud-dark.png" caption="'Colossal Cave Adventure' created by Will Crowther in 1975 was one of the first dungeon games."%}

Money, gold, points, tokens, and coins are constant companions in almost all
games. Come to think of it, most of the games that we now consider classics have
money-like objects in their virtual worlds: Mario has his coins, Sonic has his
rings, and almost every final boss will drop precious items or heaps of gold
once he is slain. In RPGs in particular, no matter what kind of creatures you
are fighting, you will probably have to acquire gold to upgrade your weapons and
armor. In single-player games, the digital coins you collect are worthless.
However, once an exchange is facilitated via _networked_ play, things start to
get interesting. Players will inevitably trade the virtual treasures they
collected over time, whether there are official trading mechanisms in the game
or not.

While there are many games that had (and still have) vast virtual economies, I
want to highlight three in particular: _Ultima Online_, _Diablo 2_, and _Second
Life_.

### Ultima Online: Planning a Virtual Economy

Ultima Online was released on September 24, 1997, by Origin Systems. It was one
of the first MMORPGs that garnered mainstream attention, attracting over 100,000
players within six months. Like the MUDs before it, the world of Ultima Online
is a _persistent_ world, which means that your actions and interactions in the
game have lasting consequences for yourself and other players. In stark contrast
to single-player games or non-persistent multiplayer games, you can not "save"
the state of your game and "load" it at a later point. Everything happens in
real-time, with real consequences for real people. Consequently, the time and
effort players put into leveling up their characters and gathering items and
resources are real as well, which, in turn, spawns real economies around these
virtual goods.

To quote Zachary Booth Simpson[^fn-zachary] who studied the in-game economics of
the game extensively: "_Ultima Online_, and online games similar to it, offer a
unique research platform because, while the commodities traded are virtual, the
resulting economies are not simulations.” Matthew Beller from the Mises
Institute[^fn-mises] echoes this sentiment: "Some economists might dismiss
virtual worlds as an application for economics, given that they do not contain
any resources that are traditionally considered scarce (lumber, steel, oil,
etc.), but a closer inspection reveals that some virtual worlds contain real
market economies complete with scarce resources, property rights,
entrepreneurship, and exchange."

[^fn-zachary]: See https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5bf1bc95506fbe3baadb7063/t/5c00ac140e2e7265722166af/1543547925580/The+In-game+Economics+of+Ultima+Online.pdf,

[^fn-mises]: https://mises.org/library/coming-second-life-business-cycle


The world of Ultima Online allows for spontaneous economic interaction between
players. Players are free to trade as they see fit, directly, without
restriction in regards to what to trade or with whom. However, some parts of the
game's economy are planned by the game's designers. For example, players can
sell their goods to NPCs, receiving gold in return. Also, players can
explore the world and harvest natural resources, e.g. hunt wild animals for fur
and meat, cut down trees to gather wood, and so on. Naturally, these
computer-controlled aspects of the game have to be pre-programmed: how much of a
good is an NPC vendor willing to buy, and for what price? How many rabbits spawn
in a certain area? How quickly will a forest regrow?

{% include image.html name="uo-economic-flow-dark.png" caption="Originally designed and revised economic flow of Ultima Online."%}

As always, human players were quick to find patterns that could be exploited.
To gain the maximum benefit from exploiting these patterns, many players used macros and
scripts to automate what would otherwise be tedious tasks.
For example, players would automate the production of goods that netted a laudable profit
when sold to NPCs, enabling them to earn money while they slept.
And since NPCs would buy anything as long as they had money, players were able to earn
more money more easily than the game designers had anticipated.
To prevent this overproduction, the game designers interfered by limiting the number of
items an NPC would buy per hour.
Of course, this had some unintended consequences, one of which is described in Simpson’s
1999 research paper:
“In order to facilitate these shopkeeper changes, the AI which required the shopkeepers to
keep a positive cash flow had to be abandoned.
Shopkeepers now effectively print gold in order to pay for the useless goods which are
being created by the manufactures.”

As history shows and this example illustrates, planning an economy—virtual or not—is an
impossible task.
Every interference, no matter how benign the central planners believe it to be, will have
unintended consequences and side effects that will beget more interference.
As we will see over and over again in these virtual worlds, players will find ways to
exploit whatever rules are in place, effectively overcoming digital scarcity.
As long as the double-spend problem isn’t solved by exploiting physical laws players will
find ways around it.

Ultima Online is no exception, as Simpson points out:
"In the early stages of UO, players discovered an obscure server fault which allowed them
to clone certain kinds of items, primarily gold and reagents.
Although the programmers discovered this cheat quickly, it took them a long time to fix
it. In the interim, the existing UO worlds became saturated with gold.
Estimates of the inflation value range from multiples of hundreds of thousands to
millions. The hyperinflation destroyed the gold economy and players resorted to bartering
and just plain-old charity during this period."

The same story plays out over and over again, no matter if the worlds are virtual or not.
If someone finds a way to print money, they inevitably will exploit this advantage, no
matter the long-term consequences.
As we shall see, this is also true if the money emerges naturally in the first place.

### Diablo 2: Duplicating the Stone of Jordan
To me, Diablo 2 is one of the great iconic games of PC game history.
Released in the summer of 2000 it quickly became one of the fastest-selling games to date,
selling over a million copies in the first two weeks.
I purchased my copy on the day the game launched (June 29th) and ended up playing it for
thousands of hours.
Alone, with friends, at LAN parties, and online.
Oh, the good old times.

Similar to Ultima Online before it, Diablo 2 is an RPG. You can play in
groups (parties) with other players, slay monsters, hunt for loot, and trade
items with others. While Diablo 2 has an in-game currency in the form of gold,
gold isn't used to facilitate trade. The reason is that the gold that players
will find in the game is _horrible_ money. First of all, the amount of gold a
player can possess is capped. Your character can only carry 10,000 gold per
level, and your stash (basically your treasure chest) can only hold between
50,000 and 2,500,000 gold, also depending on your level. Second of all, every
time you die a certain percentage of your gold will disappear. This death
penalty will cost you up to 20% of your gold, no matter where you store it. It
simply vanishes, removing itself from circulation. And third of all, gold isn't
particularly scarce. You will find it everywhere, and every NPC vendor will
gladly buy whatever junk you have and give you gold for it.

All these peculiar properties make Diablo's in-game gold horrible money. Consequently, a natural, de-facto money emerged: the _Stone of Jordan_.

{% include image.html name="soj.jpg" caption="Emergent in-game money: The Stone of Jordan"%}

The Stone of Jordan, or SoJ for short, was one of the _unique_[^fn-unique]
(read:
very rare)
rings in the game.
While it had desirable properties in and of itself, most players didn't use it as an item
to be equipped, but as a currency to facilitate trade.
The SoJ was small and rare, which made it portable and valuable.[^fn-soj-monopoly]
Using up only one slot in a player's inventory, many players had dozens of SoJs in their
stash to be used for trading.
Prices emerged naturally.[^fn-soj-endogenous]
Most desirable weapons—which usually belonged to the unique or set class—traded for
single-digit amounts of SoJs.
A _Doombringer_ sword was worth between two and four SoJs, an _Eaglehorn_ bow between five and
seven, and a mallet known as _Schaefer's Hammer_ was worth between four and six SoJs.
Any item that was worth less than a single SoJ was traded for one or more _perfect skulls_,
another de-facto currency that emerged naturally.
In essence, the perfect skull was the $1 bill of the game, and the SoJ was the $5 bill of
the game. Naturally, one SoJ would trade for 5 perfect skulls.
Only the best items were priced in the double digits in terms of SoJs.
One example would be the _Windforce_ bow that, coincidentally, my _Bowazon_ was lucky enough
to hold in her hands.
It was traded for around 40 SoJs.

[^fn-unique]: Unique items in Diablo 2 aren't unique in the literal sense, but belong to the "unique" class. Other classes are normal, superior, magic, rare, set, and crafted. Unique items are exceedingly rare, meaning that the odds that they will spawn more than once each game are nearly impossible.

The _Stone of Jordan_ eventually lost its role as the de-facto money in Diablo 2. As with
all obsolete money, its eventual downfall was that people found a way to make more of it,
cheaply.

Inflation began gradually.
Since the _Stone of Jordan_ was such a valuable item, players began to "farm" it as best as
they could. They found all kinds of ingenious ways to make it "drop" more often, inflating
the supply over time.
The game developers even introduced features into the game that would incentivize players
to get rid of the additional SoJ supply.
For example: if enough players would sell their SoJ rings to NPC vendors, a special
monster would spawn, known as the _Uber Diablo_—a clone of the final boss of the game.

Of course, the cheapest way to make more of something is not to farm it, but to copy it.
And that's exactly what players figured out to do.
People found ways to exploit certain bugs in the game and its servers, allowing them to
duplicate any item of their choosing.
These _dupes_, as they became to be known, were perfect copies of the original item.
In essence, players found a way to double-spend their digital items, leaving the game's
servers and other players none the wiser.

It didn't take long for the in-game economy to collapse.
As one player recounts:
"On June 30, 2003, several key developers left Blizzard North to form new companies.
By now the SoJ economy was in ruins [...]. I remember well the day when it all collapsed,
prices had been inflating ever so slightly for several weeks and when I logged on that
morning to do business as usual the trade channel was in a state of chaos.
Stormshields were going for 20 SoJ, other higher value items were impossible to obtain.
The heydays were over and everyone knew it.
The once busy trade channels would slowly fade to silence..."[^fn-soj-story]

[^fn-soj-story]: They-Live, Rons (2013). [The Story of the Stone of Jordan—and the Golden Era of Diablo II Lord of Destruction][soj-pdf]

[soj-pdf]: {{ '/assets/files/the-story-of-the-stone-of-jordan.pdf' | absolute_url }}

Eventually, the game developers were able to get a handle on the situation.
Most of the bugs that allowed for this duplication to happen were fixed, and systems were
put in place to identify dupes and destroy them.
Of course, this destructive process wreaked even more havoc on the whole economy, at least
in the short term.
Many players didn't know if their items were dupes or not, so imagine waking up one day to
see that half of your possessions simply vanished overnight.

Over time, other forms of money emerged.
The expansion pack "Lord of Destruction" introduced _rune words_ into the game, and with the
duping brought somewhat under control, the runes that were the atomic components of these
words eventually became the new de-facto money.
They share all the monetary properties that the SoJ had, and additionally, they varied in
rarity. This lead to runes effectively becoming the $1, $5, $10, $20, and $50 notes of the
game.

With the release of Diablo 3 in 2012, the legend of the _Stone of Jordan_ lived on.
As a nod to its monetary use in the previous incarnation of the game series, the
developers added the following sentence to the lore surrounding the ring:
"_The Stone of Jordan is far more valuable than its appearance would suggest.
Men have given much to possess it._"

Once people hone in on one form of money, they do indeed go through great pains to gather
more of the precious good.
What's true for gold and diamonds in meatspace is also true for _Stones of Jordan_ and other
rare items in cyberspace.
As we shall see, this is also true for artificially scarce goods such as designer clothes
and other luxury items.

### Second Life: Linden Lab's Interventionism

Launched in 2003, the virtual world of Second Life quickly became an economic phenomenon.
Second Life differs from the games mentioned previously since it isn't necessarily a game
in the first place.
You don't hunt monsters and go on quests, you are simply a resident of a virtual world.
It is an alternative place to meet and do things, a world where you can be anything and
anyone you want to be.
In other words:
it is an opportunity to start a second life.

Residents of Second Life craft all kinds of virtual goods:
clothing, vehicles, houses, sculptures, gadgets, artwork—anything that can be modeled in
3D. Residents can buy cosmetics to improve the appearance of their avatars, just like we
do in the real world.
Skin, hair, jewelry, custom animations—if you can imagine it, someone will craft it and
sell it to you.
Apart from objects, some focus on providing services for their fellow residents:
entertainment, education, consulting, business management, news, and yes, even banking.

As a consequence, many people ditched their real-life job to focus fully on their _Second
Life_ job. While the goods might be virtual, the profits are not, and it didn't take long
for the first self-made millionaires of Second Life to emerge.
In 2006, Anshe Chung (known as Ailin Graef in her first life) became the first person to
make over one million US dollars in Second Life.[^fn-chung]
It took her two and a half years to build her fortune, mainly working in the virtual real
estate business.

[^fn-chung]: Emma Boyes (2006). [Second Life realtor makes $1 million](https://archive.ph/TjRCH). GameSpot News.

In 2009, the total size of the _Second Life_ economy grew to USD 567 million, with gross
resident earnings of USD 55 million.
As of this writing,[^fn-this-writing] Second Life has about 50,000 residents logged into the virtual
world at any given time, and an annual GDP of
approximately USD 500 million.[^fn-sl-facts]
To quote Matthew Beller:
"Second Life's economy could reasonably be compared to that of a small foreign country
dependent on tourism."[^fn-tourism]

[^fn-this-writing]: Daniel Voyager (2022). [Second Life Grid Statistics](https://archive.ph/oWcuX)

[^fn-tourism]: https://mises.org/library/coming-second-life-business-cycle

[^fn-sl-facts]: Nick Galov (2022). [Second Life in 2022: What It Means to Live in a Virtual World](https://archive.ph/Br8Dh)

In the game itself, however, it is not US dollars that are circulating.
The currency in Second Life is the Linden dollar (L$), named after Linden Lab, the company
that created Second Life.
Residents can acquire Linden dollars by parting with their real dollars on an exchange
provided by Linden Lab.

Even though the exchange rate between the Linden dollar and the US dollar isn't fixed, the
"God" in this economy is still Linden Lab.
The company controls all aspects of the game from monetary policy to physics to what is
allowed in what region and who gets to be a resident and who will be banned.
In short: Linden Lab has the power to interfere as they see fit.
And interfere they did, many times.


Most of these "Acts of Linden," as they became known in the community, were initiated by
the company to steer the virtual world in a certain direction or improve the bottom line
of Linden Lab.
One such example would be the introduction of a value-added tax for all European residents—a tax for purchasing virtual goods, mind you.
Others, such as the global ban on gambling, were initiated because of pressure due to
real-world government regulations.
To quote the announcement of this new policy:
"Second Life Residents must comply with state and federal laws applicable to regulated
online gambling, even when both operators and players of the games reside outside of the
US."[^fn-slb]

[^fn-slb]: https://web.archive.org/web/20071216095626/http://blog.secondlife.com/2007/07/25/wagering-in-second-life-new-policy/

As with all complex systems, interference will often cause a whole set of intricate
problems down the line.
The ban on gambling, for example, lead to a run on the banks by both players and operators
of casinos, sport betting institutions, and other gambling businesses.
Consequently, one of the largest banks in the game—_Ginko Financial_—collapsed, since
most ATMs located in the gambling districts were owned by this bank.
Residents quickly drained the reserves of the bank since Ginko Financial operated on a
fractional reserve, just like banks in the real world do.
The virtual bank invested its money primarily in illiquid goods or virtual securities,
just like banks in the real world do.
It was later described as a Ponzi scheme, just like ... you get the idea.

Consequently, another "Act of Linden" followed.
Linden Lab updated their terms of services and various policies[^fn-slw]
to include a new rule for all residents of their virtual world:
everyone who offers an interest-paying service in Second Life must have a real-life
banking license.
The reason? Legal risks.

[^fn-slw]: https://web.archive.org/web/20200507122527/http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Linden_Lab_Official:Policy_regarding_inworld_banks

The following is a direct quote from the Second Life Blog:
"As of January 22, 2008, it will be prohibited to offer interest or any direct return on
an investment (whether in L$ or other currency) from any object, such as an ATM, located
in Second Life, without proof of an applicable government registration statement or
financial institution charter.
We're implementing this policy after reviewing Resident complaints, banking activities,
and the law, and we're doing it to protect our Residents and the integrity of our
economy."[^fn-slbp]

[^fn-slbp]: http://blog.secondlife.com/2008/01/08/new-policy-regarding-in-world-banks/

Second Life shows two things very clearly:
(1) Artificially regulating a complex system is not only difficult, but it will almost
always have unintended consequences that might make the problem worse.
(2) If you are a centralized, identifiable entity, the real-world state will intervene.

There is a lot to be learned from the controlled laboratory experiment that is Second
Life. In many ways, Linden Labs failed to create a stable and controlled closed-loop
economy, even with the godlike powers they have over all aspects of the game.
As Joseph Potts put it:
"whether in real life or the virtual one, the creation of money by fiat produces booms and
busts, and this even in a world in which the 'government' can and does create (all)
value."[^fn-mises-pass]

[^fn-mises-pass]: https://mises.org/wire/and-thus-it-came-pass

### Gaming and Virtual Currencies Today

Just like Bitcoin, online games and the in-game economies they create are here to stay.
For those who grew up with computer games, spending money on in-game goods is as normal as
paying for other digital goods and services such as songs, movies, or ebooks.
People will continue to spend ridiculous amounts of money on cosmetics and status symbols.
Whether these goods exist in meatspace or purely in cyberspace does not seem to matter.
Luxurious cars, expensive watches, jewelry, designer clothes—virtual or not, the money
people spend on them is real.

As of today, the most well-known game that monetizes on the purchase of cosmetic luxuries is probably
_Fortnite_. Released in 2017, the free-to-play game has attracted more than 100 million
players and earns hundreds of millions of dollars per month, mostly by selling in-game
items such as skins, characters, emotes, and so on.
Again: these items are pure cosmetics, they don't improve your character or gameplay in
any way, except for visuals.
Some of the rarer skins sell for hundreds and sometimes even thousands of dollars.
They are digital collectibles for a digital generation.

The most recent incarnation of Counter-Strike, _Counter-Strike:
Global Offensive_, is another game that sells expensive cosmetics.
Being one of the most popular first-person shooters in the world, the only parts of your
character that you see on the regular are your hands and the weapon that is held by them.
Naturally, cosmetics in _CS:GO_ are applied to what you see:
weapons. While most of these weapon skins are almost worthless, some of the rare ones
regularly trade hands for thousands of dollars on secondary markets.
Some skins are bound to championships and thus have a unique character, such as the
_Dragon Lore_ from the Boston 2018 Major, which sold for over USD 61,000 in January 2018.
Some collectors seem to have paid even more to purchase a single skin, with reports citing
up to twice that amount (over USD 100,000).[^fn-csgo]

[^fn-csgo]: See https://www.ginx.tv/en/cs-go/the-most-expensive-csgo-skin-purchase-in-history and https://www.skinwallet.com/csgo/the-most-expensive-csgo-skins-ever-sold/ and https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/csgo-dragon-lore-awp-skin-sells-for-more-than-61000/

{% include image.html name="dragonlore.png" caption="Dragon Lore AWP skin sold for USD 61,000 in 2018"%}

All of this goes to show that if left to their own devices, players will spawn vast
economies as long as the game mechanics allow for it.
One of the best examples for a flourishing economy (thanks to little intervention) is Eve
Online, an MMORPG space simulation.
The game was home to what is probably the most expensive battle in gaming history:
the _Bloodbath of B-R5RB_,
named after the star system where the battle took place.[^fn-bb]

[^fn-bb]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodbath_of_B-R5RB

Players can visit 7,800 star systems in this virtual world to explore, mine, trade, and -
of course—combat other players.
This particular battle took place in January 2014. The tally of the losses of all involved
was in the realm of 11 trillion Interstellar Kredit (ISK) or USD 330,000 at the time.
I can only echo the words of Marcus Carter, Kelly Bergstrom, and Darryl Woodford:
"_Internet Spaceships Are Serious Business_."[^fn-serious]

[^fn-serious]: https://www.amazon.de/Internet-Spaceships-Are-Serious-Business/dp/0816699089/

No discussion about in-game money is complete without mentioning the king of gold farming,
at least in terms of real-world repercussions:
_World of Warcraft_.
The virtual gold rush and the gold farms
it spawned are something to behold.[^fn-gold-farming]
While the gold was virtual, the (mostly criminal) organizations launched to systematically
harvest the in-game currency were anything but.
The idea was simple:
hire a bunch of people, pay them to play for up to 20 hours a day, and sell the gold they
find in the game to other players.
For real money, of course.
Some took the execution of this idea to the extreme.
"Companies" retro-fitted warehouses to cram as many PCs and "employees" in them as
possible. The only job of these employees was to play the game and farm gold.
In even more extreme cases prison inmates were forced to farm the digital asset all night
long.[^fn-guardian]
As Paul Tassi wrote in Forbes in 2011: "It's been discovered that in an unknown
number of Chinese prisons across the country, inmates have been forced not only to do
physical labor, but electronic work as well, acting as World of Warcraft gold farmers by
night."

[^fn-gold-farming]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming
[^fn-guardian]: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/25/china-prisoners-internet-gaming-scam

It turns out that prison bosses made more money with forced in-game labor than they made
with good old-fashioned forced physical labor in the real world.
Prisoners were compelled to work 12-hour shifts inside the game, earning up to USD 900 per
day for the prison bosses.
The _China Farmer_ phenomenon, as it became to be known in the World of Warcraft community,
was not only an ethical problem but an economic one as well.
Farming is just one method to produce more of something cheaply, and if that something is
money, the effects that come with inflation will burden the economy;
in-game or not.

While in-game economies can have repercussions in the real world, the reverse is also
true: economic events in the real world can have rippling effects that disturb virtual
worlds. One such example is the hyperinflation in Venezuela, which lead many people to
start farming gold and other valuable in-game items to make ends meet.
Venezuelans that had a computer and internet access were driven to abandon their
real-world jobs, since farming and selling virtual goods to players worldwide—sometimes
using bitcoin as the intermediate medium of exchange—brought in more money than they

As The Economist quipped:
"The law of supply and demand is ignored in Venezuela, but not online."[^fn-economist]
So many Venezuelans farmed and traded virtual goods that when the power went out during
the 2019 Venezuelan blackouts, virtual worlds such as _RuneScape_ suffered their own
economic crisis.
Imagine a lively marketplace, and suddenly, one day, the vast majority of traders (and
thus goods) can't show up.
After all, there is no online trading when you're forced to be offline because the power
is out.

<!-- TODO: This deserves to stand alone as a sole sentence para since everything -->
<!-- before it leads to this point and it's where you switch the narrative to head -->
<!-- back towards bitcoin and digital scarcity: -->

All these examples show that games are microcosms when it comes to economies and the
creation and control of money.
The difference between the Linden Dollar, World of Warcraft Gold, Fortnite V-Bucks, the
Euro, and the U.S. dollar is in scale, not in nature.
While V-Bucks are created and controlled by Epic Games (the company that created
Fortnite), the U.S. dollar is created and controlled by the Fed.
One impacts millions of people, the other billions.
The mechanism behind the money creation is the same:
decree.

Again: while the worlds might be virtual, the time and effort that people are willing to
put into building their avatars are real.
Consequently, real economies emerge.
Closed-loop virtual economies don't stay closed for long, and people will find ways to
trade their virtual goods on real marketplaces no matter if they are allowed to do so or
not. As soon as this happens, companies usually step in;
either because they are forced to do so by governments, or because they want to have a
piece of the pie, i.e. a cut for every transaction that happens in the world they created.
Ironically, this is also the reason why governments might intervene.
They want their "fair share" too.


The problem with virtual currencies—in-game or otherwise—is that they are created and managed by central decree. Consequently, they do not transcend boundaries.
It is impossible to spend your in-game money outside of the game, just like it is
impossible to spend your bolivars or lira outside of your failing country.
Sound money that emerges naturally does not have this problem.
Gold was successful because it didn't become money by decree;
it naturally emerged as money thanks to the voluntary interactions of market participants.
People realized that it has superior monetary properties compared to all other metals (and
all other goods at the time, for that matter).
The same is and will continue to be true for bitcoin.

Keep in mind that you don't need to have a background in economics or monetary history to
find the best money.
Over time, economic reality will force the best money upon you.
Those who hold superior money will win out over those who hold inferior money, and thus,
via a series of A-B tests, the money with the best monetary properties will emerge through
market forces alone.
Gold and bitcoin have a lot of things in common, the most obvious being that it is hard to
make more of them.
Fiat money and in-game currencies have a lot in common as well, e.g. the fact that they
are money by decree and controlled by central entities.

There is another thing that fiat money and in-game currencies have in common:
a lack of scarcity.
Before Bitcoin, true digital scarcity didn't exist.

### True Digital Scarcity: Solving the Double-spending Problem

As we have seen, without true digital scarcity, people will always find a way to duplicate
digital goods at near-zero marginal cost.
Can you blame them?
Ask yourself: if you would have a money printer in your basement, wouldn't you use it?
Why should you work hard to earn money, if you can just copy money to enrich yourself?

Solving the money-printing problem is especially tricky in the digital realm.
Since all digital goods are information, and information can be copied easily and
perfectly, solving the double-spending problem was thought to be impossible.
By extension, having true digital scarcity was thought to be impossible.

<!-- TODO: you've got a lot going on in that paragraph and this confuses rather
than clarifies. Perhaps drop it or shard it out for it's own expansion? -->

Bitcoin solves this problem in an ingenious way.
You don't actually hold the digital asset in the first place, but the keys to "unlock" the
asset and move it somewhere else.
There is no blob of data that you can point to and say:
"this is a bitcoin."
Consequently, you can't take that blob of data and copy it arbitrarily, making more of it.
Bitcoins exist by convention.
They exist as entries on a ledger—rows in a spreadsheet, if you will (see [Chapter 0][quick-dirty]).
The ingenious thing is that the ledger and the validation of the ledger are intricately
interwoven, producing a system that audits supply and ownership at all times.
In other words:
the network holds a record of who owns what, and it is records all the way down.
Bitcoins don't really exist.
You don't hold bitcoins.
You only hold the keys to move them.

While this distinction might be more technical than practical—after all, if someone
steals your private key he effectively has your bitcoin—it nevertheless is crucial in
solving the double-spend problem.
The system doesn't care how many copies of a private key are in existence.
It doesn't matter.
The only thing that matters are valid ledger entries.
And any copy of a private key might produce those.

Interestingly, Bitcoin didn't only solve the double-spending problem.
It isn't just digital scarcity.
Satoshi went one step further, creating something that did not and can not exist in the
physical world:
*absolute scarcity*.
