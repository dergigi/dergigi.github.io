### 21 Ways

Bitcoin is different things to different people. [21 Ways](https://21-ways.com) is my attempt
to embrace this prismatic nature of Bitcoin, exploring 21 different ways to look at Bitcoin.
It is an ambitious project, trying to dive deep into Bitcoin's different facets, including
its roots, pre-history, history, civil war, technologies built on top of Bitcoin,
surrounding economic thought, and much more. You can
[support me on Patreon](https://patreon.com/dergigi) if you want to have a look behind the
scenes and get a glimpse of this work in progress.

### 21 Lessons

[21 Lessons][21lessons] is a bit of an unusual book. But hey, Bitcoin is a bit of an unusual
technology, so an unusual book about Bitcoin might be fitting. This book came to be because
of one simple question: *What have you learned from Bitcoin?* I tried to answer this
question in a single tweet. Then the tweet turned into a tweetstorm. The tweetstorm turned
into an article. The article turned into three articles. Three articles turned into 21
Lessons. And 21 Lessons turned a book.

### Bitcoin Resources

While falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole I tried to absorb as much content in the form of
books, articles, and podcasts as humanly possible. [Bitcoin Resources][bitcoin-resources] is
my attempt to catalog and signal-boost the best and most insightful content in the Bitcoin
space. Since its inception, a growing number of people have started to contribute by
selecting and curating content.

### Bitcoin Quotes

[Bitcoin Quotes][bitcoin-quotes] is an experiment in micropayments around a growing
collection of Bitcoin-related quotes. As of this writing, 300+ quotes have been sourced and
indexed, in both audio and written form. The source of each quote will be revealed upon
paying ~2Â¢ in sats. I hope that these quotes will inform, inspire, and delight those who
stumble upon them. There is also a rudimentary [API][API] if you want to integrate these
random quotes into a project of yours. Follow the [twitter bot][btc_quotes] of this project
to get random quotes in your timeline.

{% capture time_seed %}{{ 'now' | date: "%s" }}{% endcapture %}
{% assign random = time_seed | times: 1103515245 | plus: 12345 | divided_by: 65536 | modulo: 32768 | modulo: 11 %}
{% capture n %}{% if random < 10 %}{{ '0' | append: random }}{% else %}{{ random }}{% endif %}{% endcapture %}
{% assign randompath = "/assets/images/bitcoin/projects/bitcoin-quotes" | append: n | append: ".png" %}

### Lightning Login

[Lightning Login][ll] is a site to showcase LNURL-auth, a lightweight authentication
protocol that is easy to use, easy to implement, and respects the user's
privacy.

### Opsec Swag

In-your-face Bitcoin swag is not my thing. I like more subtle stuff, which is why
I've built [OpsecSwag.com][opsecswag]. It links to various shops and outlets that
sell bitcoin merch that is opsec friendly, i.e. bitcoin merch that doesn't sport
the bitcoin logo or has any other very obvious connection to the corn.

### Einundzwanzig

[Einundzwanzig][einundzwanzig] - the German word for 21 - is a collaboration of multiple
German-speaking bitcoiners, started by Markus and myself. Started as a simple weekly podcast
focused on news in the Bitcoin space, the project continues to morph, evolve, and expand. In
addition to the weekly news show, Einundzwanzig now also dives deeper into some topics by
interviewing various experts in the German-speaking Bitcoin world. We also started to
release readings of the best Bitcoin content, thanks to the growing availability and quality
of German translations.

### 21 Lektionen

Since 21 Lessons is released under a permissive creative commons license, it has been
translated into multiple languages. *[21 Lektionen: Meine Reise in den Bitcoin
Kaninchenbau][paperback-de]* is based on the German translations of Rene and CryptoMulde,
revised and adapted by myself.

### Quotable Satoshi Twitter Bot

Building upon the great work of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, I wrote a twitter bot to
disseminate the most insightful and interesting quotes of Satoshi Nakamoto. Simply follow
[@QuotableSatoshi][quotablesatoshi] on twitter to get historical quotes from the inventor of
Bitcoin in your timeline.

### Closing the Loop

Closing the Loop is a podcast hosted by John Vallis and launched by Seetee. The
purpose of this project is to talk to the entrepreneurs, developers, and
thinkers who are contributing to "closing the loop" of the Bitcoin economy.

It is also a [value4value] experiment. Listeners can stream sats and send
boosts, including short messages if they choose to do so.

### Jam

Jam is a Web UI for JoinMarket, one of the oldest and most established Bitcoin
privacy tools that exist. It is a community-effort to make JoinMarket easier to
install and use.

### Secret Satsa

Secret Satsa is an experiment in altruism. Imagine it's Christmas time and you
are at a gas station, and the person in front of you is buying a small item for
herself or a loved one. For whatever reason she can't pay, so you step in and
pay the bill. It's the holiday season after all, right?

That's exactly what Secret Satsa is about. Strangers share lightning invoices
using the [#SecretSatsa](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SecretSatsa) hashtag, and
other strangers pay them, just because they can.

### Twentyone World

Due to the immense success of EINUNDZWANZIG, a couple of people decided to start
their own forks of in their respective countries. [Twentyone
World](https://twentyone.world) was created to visualize and encourage this. The
site serves two purposes: (1) show trusted bitcoin-only communities on a map,
and (2) make it really easy to start one. The idea is to provide an open-source
blueprint, a step-by-step guide of sorts, that should help and encourage others
to start their own localâand localizedâbitcoin-only community.

### Contribution: The Bitcoin Times

Launched by Alex Svetski in 2019, The Bitcoin Times is a publication that distills complex
topics in the world of Bitcoin into digestible pieces. As of this writing, two editions have
been published. I was one of the co-authors of the second edition, along with Rory Highside,
Nic Carter, Aleks Svetski, Robert Breedlove, Dan Held, Connor Brown, and Hass McCook.

### Contribution: Citadel 21

Citadel21 is a Bitcoin cultural zine launched by Hodlonaut and Katoshi in May 2020. Its
mission is to pull nuggets of high signal content out of the noisy chaos. I wrote an
[optimistic letter to bitcoiners][vol1] around the globe, published in the first volume, and
a piece on [identity and pseudonymity][vol4], published in the fourth volume.

### Contribution: 21ism Bitcoin Art Collective

[21ism][21ism] aims to celebrate artists across mediums, inspired to create by
the ultimate expression of freedom â Bitcoin. Art is one of the languages it
speaks & every month, 21ism takes a spin on the âCreative Carouselâ to feature
new Artists. I had the pleasure and the honor to be the first featured writer.
My article [âWhat is 21ism?â][21ism-gigi] is accompanied by a multitude of
visual and multimedia art that make the words shine in more ways than one.

### Contribution: Reckless VR

[Reckless VR][rvr] started in 2019 to create a virtual place where bitcoiners
can hang out, have some fun, and talk bitcoin among other things.

I helped moderate some of the more formal sessions and took pictures of events,
which you can find [on twitter][rvrpics].

### Code Contributions

When I'm not writing I try to contribute to open source projects where I can.
Apart from trivial fixes and contributions in various projects, I've worked on
adding [Tor] and [Dojo] support to Samourai Wallet's Sentinel app for iOS (see
[video]). I also made some corrections to [BIP 2], [BIP 16], and [BIP 69]. I
used to be part of the [Swan][joined-swan] engineering team and published a set of
[extended public key tools][xpub-tools] as open source software. Follow me on
GitHub to see what I'm up to.
