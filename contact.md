I am currently working on [my new book][21ways], so I will be harder to reach
than usual.

If you want to reach me, matrix[^fn-matrix] is probably your best bet. You can
also try the email above, or twitter, or Telegram. That being said, Twitter is
absolutely terrible when it comes to DMs, and I recently had to close my DMs
because the spam became unbearable. Telegram is alright but it is
neither private nor trustworthy, so, again, matrix is probably your best bet.[^fn-nostr]

I will do my best to reply in 3-5 days. If I don't please ping me
again. Note that I will probably not respond if I can't make out what you're up
to. A simple "hi" or "hey" without any context will be ignored. Also, I'm not
interested in trading or shitcoinery, so anything along these lines will be
deleted without an answer.

[^fn-matrix]: I'm `@dergigi:matrix.org` on matrix.

[^fn-nostr]: I'm also on nostr as `6b0d4c8d9dc59e110d380b0429a02891f1341a0fa2ba1b1cf83a3db4d47e3964` but it's very early days, so don't expect (a) nostr to work and (b) me to check my DMs there all too often.

## About Me

I‚Äôm [Gigi][true-names]. Nice to meet you.

I don't know how you ended up here. Maybe you have read some of the [things
I wrote][bitcoin]. Maybe you have seen some of my [photography] and googled the
watermark. Maybe we know each other from meatspace and you decided to check up on
me in cyberspace. It's hard to tell, really.

So, what about me? I am interested in all kinds of things, but what I'm most
passionate about is the intersection of technology and society. Which is why
the internet, and its recent brain-child [bitcoin][bitcoin], are very dear
to me.

Where things are going is always hard to tell, but I aim to be part of
the conversations and help to create a piece of the puzzle which hopefully
results in a better future. I believe that [freedom][gnu] and a move
away from centralized control are paramount for empowering individuals
and building a future worth having.

If you want to talk about these things, feel free to reach out to me. Or just [follow
along][twitter] for the ride. That's perfectly fine too.

Hope to see you around, \\
Gigi
