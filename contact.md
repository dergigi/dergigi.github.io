I am currently working on [my new book][patreon], so I might be harder to reach
than usual. There is also the fact that my inboxes are overflowing ever since
the bull began his run.[*][golden-bull]

If you want to reach me, [telegram], twitter, or the mail below is probably your
best bet. I will do my best to reply in 3-5 days. If I don't please ping me
again. Note that I will probably not respond if I can't make out what you're up
to. A simple "hi" or "hey" without any context will be ignored. Also, I'm not
interested in trading or shitcoinery, so anything along these lines will be
deleted without an answer.

## About Me

I’m [Gigi][true-names]. Nice to meet you.

I don't know how you ended up here. Maybe you have read some of the [things
I wrote][bitcoin]. Maybe you have seen some of my [photography] and googled the
watermark. Maybe we know each other from meatspace and you decided to check up on
me in cyberspace. It's hard to tell, really.

So, what about me? I am interested in all kinds of things, but what I'm most
passionate about is the intersection of technology and society. Which is why
the internet, and its recent brain-child [bitcoin][bitcoin], are very dear
to me.

Where things are going is always hard to tell, but I aim to be part of
the conversations and help to create a piece of the puzzle which hopefully
results in a better future. I believe that [freedom][gnu] and a move
away from centralized control are paramount for empowering individuals
and building a future worth having.

If you want to talk about these things, feel free to reach out to me. Or just [follow
along][twitter] for the ride. That's perfectly fine too.

Hope to see you around, \\
Gigi
