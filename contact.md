## About me

Hi! Nice to meet you. I'm [Gigi][twitter].

I don't know how you ended up here. Maybe you have read some of the [things
I wrote][medium]. Maybe you have seen some of my [photography] and googled the
watermark. Maybe we know each other from meatspace and you decided to check up on
me in cyberspace. It's hard to tell, really.

So, what about me? I am interested in all kinds of things, but what I'm most
passionate about is the intersection of technology and society. Which is why
the internet, and its recent brain-child [bitcoin][bitcoin], are very dear
to me.

Where things are going is always hard to tell, but I aim to be part of
the conversations and help to create a piece of the puzzle which hopefully
results in a better future. I believe that [freedom][gnu] and a move
away from centralized control are paramount for empowering individuals
and building a future worth having.

Sounds exciting? If you want to reach out, [twitter][twitter] or the
mail above is probably the best place. Or just follow along for the ride.
That's perfectly fine too.

Hope to see you around, \\
Gigi
