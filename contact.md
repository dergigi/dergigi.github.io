~~I am currently working on [my new book][21ways], so I will be harder to reach
than usual. I check my mail about once a month, and my DMs not much more often
than that.~~

I don't do DMs or emails. If you want to reach me, tagging me on [nostr](/nostr)
is probably your best bet. I have to focus on [my health](/lethargy) and sanity,
so the likelihood of me reading (or replying to) any messages is very very
(very) low.

## About Me

I‚Äôm [Gigi][true-names]. Nice to meet you.

I don't know how you ended up here. Maybe you have read some of the [things
I wrote][bitcoin]. Maybe you have seen some of my [photography] and googled the
watermark. Maybe we know each other from meatspace and you decided to check up on
me in cyberspace. It's hard to tell, really.

So, what about me? I am interested in all kinds of things, but what I'm most
passionate about is the intersection of technology and society. Which is why
the internet, and its recent brain-child [bitcoin][bitcoin], are very dear
to me.

Where things are going is always hard to tell, but I aim to be part of
the conversations and help to create a piece of the puzzle which hopefully
results in a better future. I believe that [freedom][gnu] and a move
away from centralized control are paramount for empowering individuals
and building a future worth having.

These days you can [find me on nostr][nostr].

Hope to see you around, \\
Gigi
