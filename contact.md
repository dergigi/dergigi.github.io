I am currently working on [my new book][21ways], so I will be harder to reach
than usual. I check my mail about once a week, and my DMs not much more often
than that.

If you want to reach me, nostr[^fn-nostr] is probably your best bet. You can
also try the email above, or twitter, or Telegram.[^fn-telegram] That being said, Twitter is
~~absolutely terrible when it comes to DMs, and I recently had to close my DMs
because the spam became unbearable~~ getting more terrible every day. Telegram
is alright but it is neither private nor trustworthy, so, again, nostr is
probably your best bet.[^fn-matrix]

I will do my best to reply in 3-5 days. If I don't please ping me
again. Note that I will probably not respond if I can't make out what you're up
to. A simple "hi" or "hey" without any context will be ignored. Also, I'm not
interested in trading or shitcoinery, so anything along these lines will be
deleted without an answer.

[^fn-matrix]: I'm also on matrix as `@dergigi:matrix.org` --- but it didn't live up to the high promises I had for it.

[^fn-nostr]: If you don't know anything about nostr, have a look at [nostr-resources.com][nr]. My current pubkey is [`npub1dergggklka99wwrs92yz8wdjs952h2ux2ha2ed598ngwu9w7a6fsh9xzpc`][npub]

[^fn-telegram]: My Telegram handle is my twitter handle.

## About Me

I‚Äôm [Gigi][true-names]. Nice to meet you.

I don't know how you ended up here. Maybe you have read some of the [things
I wrote][bitcoin]. Maybe you have seen some of my [photography] and googled the
watermark. Maybe we know each other from meatspace and you decided to check up on
me in cyberspace. It's hard to tell, really.

So, what about me? I am interested in all kinds of things, but what I'm most
passionate about is the intersection of technology and society. Which is why
the internet, and its recent brain-child [bitcoin][bitcoin], are very dear
to me.

Where things are going is always hard to tell, but I aim to be part of
the conversations and help to create a piece of the puzzle which hopefully
results in a better future. I believe that [freedom][gnu] and a move
away from centralized control are paramount for empowering individuals
and building a future worth having.

If you want to talk about these things, feel free to reach out to me. Or just [follow
along][nostr] for the ride. That's perfectly fine too.

Hope to see you around, \\
Gigi
