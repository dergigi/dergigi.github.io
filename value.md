### Time, Talent, Treasure

While treasure in the form of sats is very welcome, *time* and *talent* is very
much appreciated too!  If you can't part with your hard-earned sats, there are
[other ways to support me][support]. You can [remix or translate][translations]
my work, create an audio or video version, or simply take some time to send it
to a friend. You can also take some time to [review] my book, which helps to
feed the algorithmic gods of our present reality.

For my long-form thoughts on value-for-value see the following:

- [Dear Netizen][netizen]
- [The Freedom of Value][busking]
- [Value4Value.info][v4v-info]

**TL;DR** Give as much as you think it's worth. Thank you. üôèüß°
