If you find my work valuable, consider giving value back as you see
fit. All my work is released for free under an [open license][license] and
provided on a value for value basis.

If you can not or do not want to part with your sats there are [other ways to support me][support].

### Time, Talent, Treasure

While treasure in the form of sats is very welcome, *time* and *talent* is very
much appreciated too!  You can [remix or translate][translations]
my work, create an audio or video version, or simply take some time to send it
to a friend. You can also take some time to [review] my book, which helps to
feed the algorithmic gods of our present reality.

For my long-form thoughts on value-for-value see the following:

- [Dear Netizen][netizen]
- [The Freedom of Value][busking]
- [A Vision for a Value-Enabled Web][vew]
- [Value4Value.info][v4v-info]

**TL;DR** Give as much as you think it's worth. Thank you. üôèüß°
