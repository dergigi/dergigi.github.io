The world you know and love is no more, even if it isn't obvious to
every one of you just yet. We will look back at this moment in time, the
months we are currently living through, the weeks that will mark the
line between the pre-virus and the post-virus world. One thing is clear:
we are past the inflection point.

As the events around the COVID-19 pandemic unfold, the fragility of our
global systems becomes painfully obvious. This health crisis is
triggering a financial one, and if we don't get our act together, things
will go from bad to worse.

Both our money and our financial system has fundamental issues. Ruled
from the top down by unelected decision-makers, these structures are not
equipped to handle complex problems. Even worse, trying to fix a complex
system by heavily interfering with natural processes will turn an
annoying mosquito problem into a deadly snake problem (with some frogs
in-between).

Centralization is efficient until it isn't. I'm afraid that most of us
are going to learn this lesson the hard way: one by one, central points
of failure will crumble under the pressure of current world events, and
all we can do is watch our fragile legacy systems collapse (or turn into
Orwellian nightmares).

I'm not suggesting that all "old" systems are obsolete --- they aren't.
I'm suggesting that we are transitioning to a post-virus world, and it
will be impossible to understand what is going on --- and how problems
might be solved --- if you aren't equipped to understand and use the
tools of this new era.

The tools of the post-virus world need to be transparent, open, and
freedom-enabling. Gatekeepers, censors, and arbitrary restrictions won't
help us to solve the problems we are facing --- they will only make
things worse. Information wants to be free, and we will need all the
information out in the open to fight the battles yet to come.

I can't tell you what kind of tools will emerge. Instead, let me list
some things that are both of the utmost importance and difficult to
understand/accept if you come from the legacy world:

-   [bitcoin]
-   the internet
-   social media
-   citizen journalism
-   memes and misinformation
-   open-source and free (libre) software

Others aren't as hard to understand, but equally important: encryption,
open hardware, biohacking, DIY biology, 3d printing, and other forms of
distributed manufacturing.

These tools and the new type of thinking that comes along with them will
lead to different structures, a different way of doing things, different
outcomes. It might seem strange and inefficient at times, and that's
okay. The important part is that we move away from fragile systems and
central points of failure, building robust, and even anti-fragile
systems for generations to come.

The world is a scary, complicated, and chaotic place. Our
interconnectedness and interdependence have drastic and unforeseen
consequences, as the current pandemic shows so clearly.

 the world works."

Many systems got centralized over time, moving from robustness to
fragility: the global financial system, various supply chains, large
parts of our media apparatus, and even the money we use daily.

Complex, large-scale problems require organic, bottom-up, emergent
solutions. We, as a society, need to make sure that robust solutions can
emerge, which implies that we need to protect personal liberties and
encourage personal responsibility more than ever.

It would be great if a benevolent ruler could step in and solve all our
problems. Unfortunately, every benevolent ruler transforms into a
totalitarian dictator given enough time. And I hope we can all agree
that we don't need any more of those.

I would love to end on an optimistic note, but the future ahead will be
dark and bumpy, especially if the legacy world is all you know.
