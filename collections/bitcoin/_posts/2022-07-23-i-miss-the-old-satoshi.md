I miss the old Satoshi, straight from the node Satoshi \\
Chop up the code Satoshi, set on his goals Satoshi \\
I hate the new Satoshi, the blood fued Satoshi \\
The always rude Satoshi, go on a cruise Satoshi \\
I miss the sweet Satoshi, chop up the tweets Satoshi \\
I gotta say at that time I'd like to meet Satoshi \\
See he invented Satoshi, it wasn't any Satoshis \\
And now I look and look around and there's so many Satoshis \\
I used to love Satoshi, I used to love Satoshi \\
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Satoshi \\
What if Satoshi made a post about Satoshi \\
Called "I Miss The Old Satoshi," man that would be so Satoshi \\
That's all it was Satoshi, we still love Satoshi \\
And I love you like Satoshi loves Satoshi \\
I'm glad there's no Satoshi, all nym no face to Satoshi \\
that's very based Satoshi, cuz' now we're all Satoshi
