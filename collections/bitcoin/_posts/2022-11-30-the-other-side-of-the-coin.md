Cryptography is only one side of the coin, and cryptography is not
enough. Why? 

[Cryptography is not
enough](https://dergigi.com/2022/09/10/cryptography-is-not-enough/) because
cryptography requires secrecy. It requires key holders, and when it
comes to a global monetary system, we don\'t want anyone to hold the
\"master key.\"

In Bitcoin, your private key is only one-half of the equation. You also
need the public ledger, which records the information that is public to
all.

To ensure that public information has integrity---without falling back
to cryptography, which requires private information and thus
secrecy---we need to use something else. That something else is
proof-of-work: *computational* proof, not cryptographic proof.

\"\...we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a
peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational
proof of the chronological order of transactions.\" ---Satoshi Nakamoto

Strong cryptography makes direct attacks virtually impossible, as [Bruce
Schneier](https://21lessons.com/15/) pointed out. The universe will die
of heat death before you will be able to brute-force strong
cryptography. 

Proof-of-work makes direct attacks merely impractical, as Satoshi
pointed out. Without the luxury of private keys, we can\'t use
cryptography to construct a shield in cyberspace. We have to use
computation directly.

\"\...we proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a
public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally
impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority
of CPU power.\" ---Satoshi Nakamoto

The proof is in the pudding, i.e. in the public data itself. There are
no private keys. There is no secrecy. Everything is out in the open for
anyone to look at. Openness allows for public verification, and it is
public verification that removes trusted third parties & inspires awe.

That\'s why Bitcoin is \"high art,\" why [Bitcoin Can\'t Be
Copied](https://bitcoin-resources.com/articles/bitcoin-cant-be-copied/),
and why [there is no Bitcoin
2.0](https://bitcoin-resources.com/articles/thereisno-bitcoin20/).
That\'s why Bitcoin doesn\'t require a quorum of key holders. Truth is
embedded in the data itself. You don\'t need a key to decipher it.

Bitcoin is the most secure network, not because it has the best
cryptography, but because it has the most accumulated computational
proof. Cryptographic algorithms can be copied for free. Computational
proof can not. And because the computational proof is entangled with
Bitcoin\'s ruleset and age, and because you and you alone are
responsible for enforcing said ruleset, and because the threshold that
defines the validity of said computational proof had to grow
organically, and because you can neither copy history nor electricity,
one can only arrive at one conclusion: there is no second best.

Cryptography is only one side of the coin. The other side is the
creation and verification of computational proof, which is required to
have public data that is auditable, integral, and truthful---without
relying on trust. 

To
adopt [responsibility](https://dergigi.com/2021/03/14/the-responsibility-of-adopting-bitcoin/) for
one side of the coin---the cryptographic side---you have to hold your
own keys. **12 words**: in your head, or on a piece of paper, or stamped
into metal, or stored securely on a signing device.

To adopt responsibility for the other side of the coin---the
computational side---you have to run your own node. **21 million**:
never more.

Bitcoin\'s heartbeat is what connects the two, and what makes the coin
whole. Tick-tock, next block. Every [**10
minutes**](https://21-ways.com/2/). Every 10 minutes. Every 10 minutes.
