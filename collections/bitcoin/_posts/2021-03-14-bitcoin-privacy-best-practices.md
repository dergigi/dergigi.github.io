Not too long ago the default mode of the internet was unencrypted plain
text. Everyone was able to spy on everyone else and not too many people
thought much about it. The [global surveil­lance disclo­sures of
2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present))
changed that and today secure commu­ni­ca­tion proto­cols and end-to-end
encryp­tion are becoming the norm.

Although Bitcoin is entering its teenage years, we
are --- metaphor­i­cally speaking --- still in the plain text era of the
orange coin. Bitcoin is radically trans­parent by default, but there are
meaningful ways to protect your privacy. In this article we want to
highlight some of these ways, discuss best practices, and give
action­able advice for newcomers and bitcoiners alike.

## Why Privacy Is Important

"Privacy is neces­sary for an open society in the electronic age.
Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want
the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't
want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selec­tively reveal
oneself to the world."

With these powerful words Eric Hughes opened his [Cypher­punk's
Manifesto](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/cypherpunk-manifesto.txt)
in 1993. The differ­ence between privacy and secrecy is subtle, but
impor­tant. Choosing to remain private does not imply that one has
secrets or has something to hide. To illus­trate this just realize that
what you do on the toilet or in the bedroom is neither illegal nor
a secret (in most cases), yet you close the door and pull the curtains.

Similarly, how much money you have and where you spend it is not
neces­sarily a secret matter. It should, however, be a private one. Most
would agree that your boss should not know how you choose to spend your
salary.\
The impor­tance of privacy is recog­nized by many inter­na­tional
bodies. From the *American Decla­ra­tion of the Rights and Duties of
Man* to the United Nations, it is recog­nized that privacy is
a funda­mental human right worldwide.

> No one shall be subjected to arbitrary inter­fer­ence with his
> privacy, family, home or corre­spon­dence, nor to attacks upon his
> honour and reputa­tion. Everyone has the right to the protec­tion of
> the law against such inter­fer­ence or attacks.

## Bitcoin and Privacy

Although Bitcoin was often described as an anony­mous method of payment
by early propo­nents and by the media, it is anything but. Bitcoin is
pseudo­ny­mous at best and as of today making sure that your
pseudo­ny­mous bitcoin identi­ties cannot be linked to your real-world
identity proves diffi­cult for most people. 

Bitcoin is an open system. Its public ledger can be inspected and
studied by everyone. Thus every trans­ac­tion that is embedded in its
proof-of-work chain will be exposed for as long as Bitcoin exists:
eternity. Failing to follow privacy best practices now can poten­tially
have negative reper­cus­sions in the future.

Privacy, like security, is a process and it is diffi­cult, but not
impos­sible. Tools continue to be devel­oped to help preserve privacy
while using Bitcoin and fortu­nately most of these tools become easier
to use over time. Unfor­tu­nately no panacea exists. One has to remain
aware of the trade­offs and follow best practices as they evolve.

## Privacy Best Practices

As with every­thing in Bitcoin, taking control of your privacy is
a gradual, step-by-step process. Learning about and imple­menting these
best practices takes patience and respon­si­bility, so do not be
discour­aged if it seems overwhelming at first. Every step, no matter
how small, is a step in the right direction.

The following are action­able steps you can take to increase
your privacy:

-   Self-custody your coins
-   Do not reuse addresses
-   Minimize exposure to KYC (Know Your Customer)
-   Minimize exposure to third parties
-   Run your own node
-   Use the Light­ning Network for small transactions
-   Do not use public block explorers
-   CoinJoin early and often

**Self-custody your coins:** Not your keys, not your bitcoin. If someone
else is holding your bitcoin for you, they know every­thing there is to
know about these coins: amounts, trans­ac­tion histo­ries, future
trans­ac­tions, etc. Taking self-custody of your coins is the first and
most essen­tial step.

**Do not reuse addresses:** Reusing addresses destroys the privacy of
both the sender and the receiver. It should be avoided at all costs.

**Minimize exposure to KYC:** Linking your real-world identity to your
bitcoin addresses is a neces­sary evil in most juris­dic­tions. While
the effec­tive­ness of these regula­tions is question­able, the
impli­ca­tions for regular users are mostly negative as a multi­tude of
data leaks have shown. If you choose to use KYC on- or off-ramps, make
sure that you under­stand the relation­ship between yourself and the
service in question. You are trusting this service with your personal
data, including the future safety of this data. If you still earn
fiat-denom­i­nated income, we recom­mend using one bitcoin-only service
that allows you to execute automatic recur­ring buys on your behalf.
Swan Bitcoin is such a service. If you want to skip KYC entirely, have
a look at [no-KYC only](https://bitcoinqna.github.io/noKYConly/).

**Minimize exposure to third parties:** [Trusted third parties are
security holes](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
If you can rely on yourself instead of trusted third parties,
you should.

**Run your own node:** Not your node, not your rules. Running your own
node is essen­tial to use Bitcoin in a private manner. Every
inter­ac­tion with the Bitcoin network is facil­i­tated by a node. If
you are not in control of this node, whatever you are doing is seen by
the node you are inter­acting with. This means whoever is in control of
the node is able to see what you are doing. This [node
guide](https://bitcoiner.guide/node/) is a great resource to get
you started.

**Use the Light­ning Network for small trans­ac­tions:** The off-chain
nature of the light­ning network increases the trans­ac­tional privacy
of its users without having to jump through too many hoops. While it is
still early, the absolutely reckless days of the light­ning network are
likely behind us. Using it for small- and medium-sized trans­ac­tions
can help improve both your privacy as well as your fee footprint.

**Do not use public block explorers:** Looking up addresses in public
block explorers will link those addresses with your IP, which, in turn,
can be linked to your real identity. Software packages like
[Umbrel](https://getumbrel.com/) and [myNode](https://mynodebtc.com/)
make it easy to run your own block explorer. If you have to use a public
block explorer, make sure to mask your IP by connecting to them via
[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/), or at least use
a [VPN](https://mullvad.net/).

**CoinJoin early and often:** Because Bitcoin is forever, using
trans­ac­tional best practices such as collab­o­ra­tive CoinJoin
trans­ac­tions will ensure that your privacy is protected going forward.
While CoinJoin trans­ac­tions are nuanced, user-friendly software exists
to help you create and automate these kinds of trans­ac­tions.
Samourai's [Whirlpool](https://samouraiwallet.com/whirlpool) is a great
solution for Android users, for example. There is also JoinMarket, 
which, thanks to projects like 
[JoininBox](https://github.com/openoms/joininbox), can be set up quite
easily on your own node. Note that Swan offers the ability to
[auto-withdraw your
bitcoin](https://help.swanbitcoin.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046166054-Why-should-I-withdraw-my-Bitcoin-when-it-reaches-a-certain-threshold-),
allowing you to automate this process almost completely.

## Conclusion

Everyone should strive to use bitcoin in a more private manner. Privacy
is not secrecy. Privacy is a human right and we should all protect and
exercise this right. It is hard to remove infor­ma­tion from the
internet; it is impos­sible to remove infor­ma­tion from Bitcoin's
public ledger.

While far from perfect, tools exist today that make following privacy
best practices easier. We have highlighted some of these tools
and --- as new improve­ments such as Taproot and Schnorr get
activated --- these tools, as well as the privacy guaran­tees of
Bitcoin, will undoubt­edly improve.

Bitcoin's opera­tion does not map nicely on to tradi­tional concepts.
Questions such as "who owns this money" or "[where is it
from](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/From_address)" become hard to answer in
most circum­stances and absolutely meaning­less in others. 

Satoshi designed Bitcoin with privacy in mind. On the protocol level
every bitcoin trans­ac­tion is a "smelting" process leaving only
heuris­tical bread­crumbs behind. The protocol does not care where the
sats came from. Neither does it care about real-world identi­ties or
owner­ship. It only cares about the validity of signatures. 

And as long as speech is free, signing a message --- privately or
not --- must not be a crime.
