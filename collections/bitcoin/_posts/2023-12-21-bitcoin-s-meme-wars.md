Someone whose star continues to rise once said that "Bitcoin isn't
just memes." I disagree. It's all memes, all the way down. Let me
explain.

### What's in a meme?

Before we get into the weeds of the matter, let's take a closer look at
the words we are dealing with. According to the American Heritage
Dictionary of the English Language, a meme is "a unit of cultural
information, such as a cultural practice or idea, that is transmitted
verbally or by repeated action from one mind to another."

The term was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book and is a nod to
the word "gene," the unit of biological information that is
transmitted sexually from one organism to another.

Dawkins realized that cultural information is similar in nature to
biological information, spreading and mutating just the same, albeit on
a higher level of abstraction. Just like with biological information,
the ultimate test for cultural information is survival, and just like
biological information, it has to be fit for the environment in order to
propagate and keep itself alive.

Some ideas just don't work if they are out of place or the time isn't
ripe for them. They will quickly die, just like the proverbial fish out
of water. Other memes might work for a time, fading away slowly due to
gradual changes in the environment or collapsing suddenly due to
destructive feedback loops they bring about. Like genes, in the long
term, memes only propagate if they benefit the organism-environment.

What does that have to do with Bitcoin? Well, you'll have to ask
yourself how the Bitcoin network comes into existence, and once you do
that, you'll realize that Bitcoin isn't too different from the memes
and genes discussed above. Bitcoin is instantiated computer code, a
digital organism that pays humanity to keep it alive, as Ralph Merkle so
aptly put it. The cumulative work embedded in Bitcoin's
[timechain][time] is what makes Bitcoin real and what
makes it different from ordinary information. And ordinary computer
programs, for that matter. Just like there's a difference between you
and a print-out of your DNA, there's a difference between the Bitcoin
code---the memes that it implements---and the real-world
instantiation of Bitcoin.

[time]: {{ '/time' | absolute_url }}

The Bitcoin network instantiates and validates itself every 10 minutes,
block by block, like clockwork. It is these blocks that are the unit of
information that is transmitted, and yes, just like with memes, this
information is cultural information. The fact that this information is
transmitted electronically doesn't matter; it still embodies the core
of the Bitcoin culture, the soul of the network. And just like memes,
this information is transmitted by repeated action from one node to
another. And before that, from one mind to another.

In the ecological sense, we all transact with Bitcoin, and it transacts
with us. If you've heard of Bitcoin, if you are aware of the "21
million" meme, Bitcoin transacted with you. Way before you made your
first bitcoin transaction.

### Memes and their Environment

Bitcoin is people, when it comes down to it. Yes, it's software, but
people have to run the software and, more importantly, decide for
themselves what Bitcoin is. There is no authority when it comes to
Bitcoin. Thus everyone has to figure out what Bitcoin is independently,
and out of the overlap of the different points of view, consensus
emerges. This is a constant process because it is not only about what
Bitcoin is currently, but it is also about what Bitcoin could be. What
Bitcoin should be. That's what [The Blocksize
War](https://bitcoin-resources.com/books/the-blocksize-war) was all
about. A battle for Bitcoin's soul. A difference in opinion regarding
the future and ultimate purpose of Bitcoin. A difference in memetic
material, one that ultimately led to a split in the protocol, which led
to a split in the network, and a split in the culture.

But even without a split, even when in consensus, the question in
regards to "what Bitcoin is" is not clear-cut.

To you, the Lightning Network might not be important, and you're free
to run a pre-SegWit version of Bitcoin. For someone else, dickbutts and
farts on the blockchain might not be important, and they might decide to
run a pre-Taproot version of Bitcoin (or run a version that disrespects
ordinals). Bitcoin is backward compatible, and upgrades are optional
precisely because there is no authority to dictate things.

That's how bitcoin works, and that's how it will always work, which is
why memes are important and why it actually is memes all the way down.

You voluntarily have to opt-in to use Bitcoin. You have to be convinced
of [the idea][idea] first, the idea of accepting sats, of dropping fiat and
acquiring corn. Only after you've convinced yourself that electronic
cash with a fixed supply might be useful will you start accepting it or
start saving in it.

[idea]: {{ '/idea' | absolute_url }}

The meme "21 million" comes first, and after our brains have been
sufficiently infected by the idea, we'll run the software that brings
the 21 million into existence.

Of course, some people---most people, I believe---come to bitcoin in
a roundabout way. They think it's a speculative asset, something that
exists to make more dollars, which is to say to make more fiat. Or they
discover it via online gambling or other avenues, and this is how their
first sats come their way. But even when arriving at bitcoin in a
roundabout way, even when bitcoin arrives at your doorstep without you
understanding what you are dealing with, you will have to learn how to
use bitcoin in a self-sovereign way, or you're not gonna make it.

Running Bitcoin in a self-sovereign way implies absorbing the memes of
Bitcoin. For example, you will have to absorb and agree with "21
million," or what you've got on your hands is not bitcoin, but a
shitcoin. Running bitcoin means acting out Bitcoin, which in turn means
holding your own keys, running your own node, and agreeing to the core
consensus parameters that make bitcoin bitcoin.

Over time, a horizontal meme transfer will take place. Bitcoin will rub
off on you. Not only will you be exposed to the ideas that are embedded
in Bitcoin; no, you will be part of it all, living the meme by holding
the corn, day-to-day, block-to-block.

{% include image.html name="bitcoin-zen.jpg" caption="Bitcoin Zen" %}

Or you won't. If you disagree with the ideas embedded in Bitcoin's
consensus parameters, you have two choices: fork off, or suffer from
Bitcoin Derangement Syndrome. You could also, of course, adapt to the
environment and live in symbiosis with it, which is to come to terms
with the memetic material embedded in Bitcoin---accepting it, and
slowly agreeing with it.

Using the ecological lens sketched out before, Bitcoin and bitcoiners
form the organism-environment, influencing each other in 10-minute
intervals. The tricky thing is that Bitcoin is both organism and
environment, as are we. The Bitcoin meme lives in our brains and our
idea of what Bitcoin is---and what it should be---changes over time.
The economic extension of us---our sats---live in the environment
that is Bitcoin, an environment that we bring about, individually and
collectively.

We shape our tools, and our tools shape us. And we use our tools to
shape our environment, which, of course, shapes us as well. Culture is a
result of this mutual shaping, and what is culture but a multitude of
memes?

In Bitcoin, we are dealing with an incredible opinionated tool, one that is
intimately wrapped up with us. A tool that creates an environment that is
ridiculously hard to change. I would even go as far as saying that some aspects
of this strange [meme-tool-organism-environment loop][loop] are impossible to
change, as it would destroy the identity of Bitcoin and bitcoiners alike.

[loop]: {{ '/2019/05/01/bitcoins-gravity/#loop' | absolute_url }}

To me, Bitcoin will always be defined by
[twentyoneism][21ism], even if
I'm the last one who believes this meme. I'd rather die on the hill of
21 million---alone and in poverty, node in hand, twelve words in my
head---than agree to raise the bitcoin supply by 1%.
([Mandibles.](https://bitcoin-resources.com/books/the-mandibles))

[21ism]: {{ '/21ism' | absolute_url }}

There are those who accept this unchanging environment and those who
reject it, which, naturally, leads to a split in culture.

### Cultural Splits

We are undoubtedly living through a Culture War of sorts. Left vs.
Right, Red vs. Blue, Based vs. Woke, Blue Bird vs. Purple Bird, and
furries vs. normal people. It's hard to pinpoint the fault lines that
are the underlying reason for this war. Some believe it boils down to
individualism vs. collectivism. Others see it as capitalism vs. marxism,
self-regulating order vs. central planning. Others speculate that this
mess is related to a decline in religious belief, a result of the
Nietzschean assassination of God.

All of these reasons might be valid or partly valid, but for me, as a
bitcoiner---as someone who has marveled at the graphs of "[WTF
happened in 1971](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/)" many times---it is
hard to point to anything other than the emergency of fiat money as the
main underlying reason for the chaos we are living through. To me, it
seems obvious that these crazy times are a result of the fiat monetary
system and the economic as well as the memetic consequences it brings
with it. It is a system that is completely disconnected from reality, an
artificial and highly political environment that, whether we realize it
or not, is the economic operating system of our world. To me, the fault
line of society is best summarized as "bitcoin vs. fiat."

{% include image.html name="bitcoiner-political-compass.jpg" %}

We are now 50 years into acting out the idea of fiat money. The meme
that the nature of base money doesn't matter, the stubborn conviction
that "we owe it to ourselves." We seem to think that our collective
future is a magical golden pot---seemingly without a bottom---that
we can borrow from over and over and over again.

I believe that we are in the final stages of the great fiat experiment.
Once more, the arrogant kings of this world decided to play God and
meddle with forces that are greater than them, greater than us. Once
more, we are finding out that printing money doesn't produce any actual
value. Once more, society will transform or outright collapse, as it did
in Egypt, Rome, and in many other cultures before ours. And, once more,
nature will reassert itself by wreaking havoc and killing off everything
that is not in accordance with it. Be it ideas or otherwise.

> So when the money failed in the land of Egypt and in the
> land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, ‘Give us
> bread, for why should we die in your presence? For the money has
> failed.
>
><cite>[Genesis 47:15][god]</cite>

[god]: https://bitcoin-resources.com/books/thank-god-for-bitcoin

This time around, however, the fiat experiment is not locally contained.
It's not the money of a single country that is failing but the meme
of fiat money itself.

### Printing Money vs. Fixing The Money

Realizing the importance of money, as well as the moral and cultural
implications of the nature of money---and [the ethics of money
production](https://bitcoin-resources.com/books/the-ethics-of-money-production)
---has altered my worldview irreversibly. Once I realized that money
printing is simply wealth redistribution and that centrally planned
wealth redistribution is an impossible task---not only
computationally, but morally---it dawned on me that confiscation by
inflation and other forms of involuntary redistribution is nothing more
than roundabout stealing. The fiat system is a system of
[slavery](https://bitcoin-resources.com/articles/mastersand-slavesof-money/),
and no, this is not an exaggeration.

Here's the good news, however: [Bitcoin fixes
this](https://bitcoin-resources.com/series/gradually-then-suddenly/).

{% include image.html name="silicon-valley-bank.jpg" caption="This is our <a href='https://dergigi.com/memeworld'>meme world</a>, everyone else is just living in it." %}

There is a certain ethic embedded in Bitcoin, and it is this ethic that forms
the cornerstone of the memes we see emerge and propagate. If I had to sum it up
in one phrase, it would be this one: "[You shall not steal.][cryptography]" If
I had to sum it up in one number, it would be, of course, 21 million.

[cryptography]: {{ '/cryptography' | absolute_url }}

The motivation behind the creation of Bitcoin is undoubtedly political,
as "chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks" and various
comments by Satoshi tell us. For example, while Satoshi agreed with the
statement that "you will not find a solution to political problems in
cryptography," he also mentioned that "we can win a major battle in
the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom." Note the words used
in this statement: a territory (environment) of freedom (opposite of
slavery).

I would argue that "win a major battle" is an understatement, and I
would also argue that the original assertion is wrong, but I'll come
back to that.

Yet even without these comments, even if the message embedded in the
Genesis block would be "ooga chaka ooga ooga ooga chaka," bitcoin
would still be political. Yes, the resulting system is apolitical, just
like the sunrise is apolitical, but the act of creating bitcoin is a
political act. It is a statement, a manifestation of specific ideas, of
quality memes.

Contrast the ethic embedded in Bitcoin (fixed supply, no forced
redistribution, no free lunch, no bailouts) to the ethic of fiat money
(endless supply, centrally planned redistribution, bailouts for friends,
everything is made up)---or, even more drastically, the "ethic" of
shitcoins, which is just fiat money on steroids (everyone can print
their own money, nothing matters, rug-pulls are funny and dickbutts are
basically the Mona Lisa).

Is it any surprise that the culture around these phenomena is so
different? Or is "you will own nothing and you'll be happy" simply a
downstream effect of the meme that is fiat money? Is the cultural
difference between bitcoiners and shitcoiners a natural result of the
memes embedded in and brought about by the different
organism-environments?

{% include image.html name="own-nothing-no-privacy-be-happy.png" %}

Translated to plain language, the meme of fiat money---the idea that
we can and should create money from thin air---is simply saying, "I
know better than the market how to allocate money", which is to say to
know better than everyone else what is good and what is bad, what is
valuable and what isn't, what is necessary and what is superfluous.

The question that the fiat system answers is the following: who is
allowed to counterfeit currency, and how much? Further, who is allowed
to have access to money, and who isn't? The answer is political and
enforced by violence.

The Bitcoin system is answering the same questions, and the answers are
as simple as they are ethical: nobody is allowed to counterfeit money,
and anyone can access it. No exceptions.

These are two very different ideas, two very different memes. One is
implemented in the fiat system; the other is implemented in the Bitcoin
system. One is breaking at the seams; the other is chugging along,
growing economically, computationally, and memetically---every 10
minutes.

### Bitcoin vs. Gold

When it comes to identifying the root cause of many of our ills, gold
bugs had the right idea (for the most part). But they had no way to
implement their ideas in a meaningful and effective way, a way that
works in the networked world of the 21st century. The meme of "sound
money" is the right meme, but without a way to act out said meme
efficiently, the meme has no way of spreading itself throughout the
population.

Here's the deal, dear gold bugs: We won't return to a gold standard.
Gold has failed in the past, and it would fail again in the future. The
usefulness of the "gold standard" meme has come to an end. The remnant
of its glorious past will be found in linguistics only.

"Why," you ask? Well, for starters, the physical body of gold forbids
teleportation, which is to say, the electronic transmission of gold. It
forbids invisibility, i.e., the plausible deniability of possession.
Bitcoin can be teleported instantly and hidden perfectly. It can be held
in your head, and nobody can know if you actually hold bitcoin or not.
Gold will always be centralized in vaults for logistical reasons alone.
Bitcoin doesn't have to be. Gold will always inflate at a certain rate,
as an unknown amount is still underground (and out in space). The amount
above ground is unknown as well, as the global supply of gold can't be
audited easily.

Contrast that to bitcoin: absolutely scarce and perfectly auditable.
Every 10 minutes, the total supply of bitcoin is audited. Every 10
minutes, its emission schedule is verified. Every 10 minutes, billions
of sats are settled, finally and electronically, which is to say at the
speed of light. Real, physical settlement. Global and instant, without
much cost or friction. Every 10 minutes.

{% include image.html name="bitcoin-vs-gold.jpg" %}

The gold meme will still spread for a while, and that's okay. People
are nostalgic, especially if they are set in their ways. As with
scientific revolutions, the monetary revolution that is currently
underway will probably spread slowly: one funeral at a time.

I believe, however, that Bitcoin has the power to win the minds and
hearts of people very quickly, if said minds are open or culturally
aligned enough; or if the change in their environment is drastic enough.

[Gradually, then
suddenly](https://bitcoin-resources.com/series/gradually-then-suddenly/).

### Politics vs. Culture

Let's return to the assertion that "you will not find a solution to
political problems in cryptography." I mentioned before that I
disagree, and here's why. Politics is downstream from culture, and
cryptography in general (and Bitcoin in particular) changes culture.

This should be clear as day to anyone but the most blind observer of the
Bitcoin space. The culture around bitcoin is steeped in responsibility
and self-ownership ("hold your own keys" & "not your keys, not your
coins"), verification and reasoning from first principles ("[don't
trust, verify](https://21lessons.com/16/)"), long-term thinking and
saving for the future ("[stay humble, stack
sats][family]"), as
well as a focus on hard work, integrity, truth, and visible outcomes
("[proof-of-work][pow]").

[family]: {{ '/family' | absolute_url }}
[pow]: {{ '/pow' | absolute_url }}

Satoshi, in true cypherpunk fashion, realized that memes have to be
implemented to be most efficiently spread, which is why he sat down and
wrote the code. It was also the first test regarding the fitness of his
ideas, as he mentioned in one of his many forum posts: "I had to write
all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every
problem, then I wrote the paper."

That's proof-of-work, right there. That's anti-fiat. Not only talking
about it, but doing it. Leading by example. Not only speculating about
the ideas you have in mind, the memes you want to see propagate in this
world, but implementing them. Which is to say: putting them to the test
against reality.

> Don’t let your memes be dreams.
>
><cite>[Satoshi][code] (paraphrased)</cite>

[code]: https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/6/

Is it any surprise that bitcoin is spreading into the "sound food,"
"sound farming," free speech, and human rights communities? That
bitcoin is quickly and easily understood by people who are literally
close to the ground, connected with the base reality of things? Is it
any surprise that bitcoin is used and understood readily by those who
need it most? By those who are living in countries where the money is
failing? By those who are rejected by the fiat system?

It shouldn't be a surprise. Some cultures have a natural overlap with
Bitcoin's culture, and it's these cultures that will adopt Bitcoin
first. Early examples are the cypherpunk culture, as well as the
cultures around Austrian economics, libertarianism, and Muslim finance.
As these cultures adopt bitcoin, Bitcoin will, in turn, adopt these
cultures and influence them. A mutually beneficial influence, as is
required by anything that survives long-term, as is the default for the
symbiosis that is nature. The organism-environment that is created by
the orange coin and those who hold it wants to survive. Bitcoin: the
selfish meme.

Of course, there are also fiat memes. It is what defined our culture for
the last 50 years: "fake it till you make it" and "YOLO" come to
mind, which, interestingly enough, is the modern version of the
Keynesian idea that, in the long run, we're all dead. Is it any
surprise that an environment brought about by fake money results in fake
food, fake bodies, fake health, fake medicine, fake relationships, fake
experts, and fake people?

Those who sit on the top of the fiat pyramid speak of "useless
eaters," trying to convince us that we don't need to have ownership of
anything, but we'll be happy all the same. One has to marvel at the
slogan: "You'll own nothing and you'll be happy."

"You'll be a happy little slave," is what this particular meme is
saying. Someone decided that happiness is the ultimate goal to be
achieved, and they (and only they) know how to achieve it for you.

{% include image.html name="omg-let-people-enjoy-things.jpg" %}

As if happiness was the ultimate goal in the first place, the end-all and
be-all, the reason for our existence. What about the pursuit of something
meaningful, something that is hard, something that requires sacrifice, which
implies pain and suffering?

> Every man is happy until happiness is suddenly a goal.

><cite>[Tame Impala][impala]</cite>

[impala]: https://youtu.be/sBEfo73lOvk

Or what about the statement by Lagarde that "we should be happier to
have a job than to have our savings protected?" That's an expression
of a certain meme stuck in her head, the meme that job security trumps
most other needs and that regular people do not need to accumulate
wealth. Even worse: it suggests that it's perfectly fine to steal what
regular people managed to save, diligently working over the course of
their lives.

{% include image.html name="lagarde-jobs.jpg" %} 

There is a reason why we speak of "the rat race" and why this part of
our culture is so heavily criticized in art and film. To quote Tyler
Durden: "Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we
hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of
history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great
Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war\... our Great Depression is
our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day
we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we
won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very
pissed off."

I don't think that people are pissed off, however. I believe that
people are mostly depressed and nihilistic. They don't see a way out;
they are hopeless and have accepted their position in the system---be it
consciously or unconsciously.

Nothing shows the drudgery of the fiat rat race better than the short
animated movie "[Happiness]" which is a visual journey of man's
unrelenting quest for fulfillment in the modern world. It puts into
pictures what many people fail to put into words. Helplessness,
addiction, hopelessness. A crisis of self, a crisis of meaning. A lack
of a hopeful vision for the future.

[Happiness]: https://youtu.be/e9dZQelULDk

"Quite frankly, it gets quite depressing," to quote a 44-year-old
working-class man who is stuck in the woods alone. "I've been trying
to formulate a thought, to express it, without breaking down and crying.
But I'm not sure to be able to relay it, without crying."

"So my issue, one of the reasons why I wanted to come out here, was to
try and think on the new aspect of my life. In other words: after
kids."

"A person can endure a lot of things, for someone that they love.
Trying to endure the same things, just purely for yourself, is not that
easy. I'm an electrician. You might think it's not that hard, but
it's a lot of repetitive tasks. I know everybody has their own work, I
know that's just the way of the world. But for me, to think that I have
another 15 years of basically wasting my life, waiting for the weekends.
Just the mundane torture of it all\..."

Watch [the clip] if you have the chance. 
It's one thing to theorize about the meme of the rat race; it's
another thing to watch a grown man break down crying after reflecting on
his life, the system he is embedded in, and the future that this system
has in store for him. After wiping away his tears, he goes on to
speculate what the reason for his depressive outlook might be: "This
place I know the rules. It's life outside of this place that makes me
wanna cry."

[the clip]: https://bitcointv.com/w/m93jXXQz8iq3CF3rFtsrn7

That's it, isn't it? Rules and rule changes. If you want to deeply and
utterly depress someone, change the rules, and change them often. Force
them to do something meaningless. Change the rules arbitrarily. That's
what really demoralizes people: being imprisoned in a system of
arbitrary rule changes. No hope for stability and no way out.

When it comes to monetary policy, the fiat system has no rules. "The
rules are made up and the points don't matter," to paraphrase Drew
Carey. Reality has rules, and once a fiat system gets out of whack
enough, it is reality that brings the consequences, not the fiat system
itself.

The fiat system is broken; its money is worthless; its culture is
depressed and hopeless. If politics is downstream from culture, is it
any surprise that our politics is mostly a clown show, focused on
appearances and on the short-term only? Where to find hope in the
hopeless world of fiat everything? Broken ideas lead to broken
environments, which in turn lead to broken organisms. Once man is
broken, he will not be able to change his environment in a mutually
beneficial way. To the contrary. He will be stuck in a downward spiral
of despair and destruction, trying to do "whatever it takes" "at all
costs."

Without Bitcoin, the prospect of our future is bleak. Without bitcoin,
you have two options: the black pill of pessimism or the Soma of
nihilism.

There is a reason why people say that [Bitcoin is hope][hope].

[hope]: https://hope.com

### Black Pill vs. Orange Pill

Bitcoin is hope because Bitcoin's rules are known and stable. The
Bitcoin system is insanely reliable, operating like clockwork, with
rules that are known and set in stone. It is an environment of iron-clad
constraints that are enforced without rulers.

Not only is it the opposite of the fiat system, but it is also its
antidote. Not only a lifeboat, ready to be boarded by anyone who is in
need, but also a cure, providing meaning and optimism where there was
none before.

It's easy to get depressed once you've identified the ills of the fiat
system. Many bitcoiners who are filled with optimism today were hopeless
and fatalistic before they took the orange pill. Many people still are,
Lionel Shriver and most gold bugs included.

But you have to be ready. You can only orange-pill yourself, as they
say. Nobody can force Bitcoin down your throat.

You need to have an epiphany, the same epiphany as our 44-year-old
electrician in the woods, reflecting on his life. Shortly after his
breakdown and his monologue about being stuck in the rat race, he comes
to a sudden realization: "I'm gonna have to make a change. It's not
the world that has to change. It's me that needs to change. It's my
outlook on life."

Yes. What a Chad.

{% include image.html name="yes-chad-network.png" caption="That's literally how Bitcoin works." %}

### Fiat Mind vs. Bitcoin Mind

The fiat system will not fade away easily, nor will it disappear
quietly. Too many people are still infected with the meme of easy money,
working bullshit jobs, and living fiat lives. The death of the fiat
organism is unavoidable, however. It is self-destructive, and like all
animals that are cornered and on the brink of death, it will lash out in
a last-ditch attempt to avoid the unavoidable.

"Our great war is a spiritual war," as Tyler Durden so aptly put it.
And we are right in the thick of it.

![Pigs](/assets/images/bitcoin/2023-03-21-bitcoin-s-meme-wars/pigs-combined.webp#full)

With each passing day, it's becoming more and more obvious that this is
a spiritual war. A clash of ideas, a battle of differing worldviews.

Even the [final boss of
Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/dergigi/status/1275800659447746562?s=20),
Augustin Carstens, knows that this is a war. Why else would he, the
embodiment of the fiat standard, appear on TV, stating the following?

If we wouldn't be wound up in memetic warfare, why would it be
necessary to state that a battle has been won?

If we wouldn't be in the midst of a spiritual war, why would [Christine
Lagarde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrkxkBSvOUg), a person that was
convicted of negligence and misuse of public funds---a person who is
now the President of the European Central Bank---state publicly that
we have to regulate Bitcoin at a global level, because, "if there is an
escape, that escape will be used"?

Why would Stephen Lynch assert that bitcoin will "go to zero when we
come up with a CBDC that has the full faith and credit of the United
States behind it"?

Why would [Neel Kashkari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czOKULHVBeE),
crazy-eyed as he is, go in front of a camera to perpetuate the meme that
"there is infinite cash in the federal reserve," hoping that this
statement would instill confidence in the failing fiat system?

It's almost impossible to watch these interviews without shaking one's
head. Do these people truly believe what they are saying? Is it malice,
or is it ignorance? Or is it simply an outgrowth of the distorted
worldview of the fiat mind? Are these people beyond redemption, or could
Bitcoin humble even them, putting them on the path of responsibility and
fiscal discipline?

Whatever the answer may be, Bitcoin's mere existence is offensive to
their minds, or to any fiat mind, for that matter. Bitcoin invalidates
the idea that money has to be created by the state. Its architecture
says, "anyone should have access to the monetary system." Its design
says, "we see what you've been doing, fiat people, and we will put a
stop to it."

It is ironic that what most fiat people see at first are the battle
cries of bitcoiners, screaming "HODL!" and shouting "we will make you
obsolete" from the rooftops. They fail to see the deeper truth of these
memes, the fact that these memes come from a deep conviction that a
mathematically and thermodynamically sound system is preferential to a
political one. They don't hear the humming of the ASICs, nor do they
pay attention to the valid blocks that are coming in without fail.
Every 10 minutes, whispering quietly:

[<center>"You shall not steal."</center>][cryptography]

The loud and boastful surface phenomenon is easy to ridicule and
dismiss. The deeply technical, economic, and game-theoretical organism
that brings about the 21 million, not so much. Both are growing. Both
are intertwined. One can not exist without the other.

### Fiat Self vs. Bitcoin Self

Upon first contact, Bitcoin is dismissed by most. In a world ruled by
[The Fiat
Standard](https://bitcoin-resources.com/books/the-fiat-standard), most
people are unable to comprehend the orange coin when they initially
stumble upon it. I think it's safe to say that most bitcoiners didn't
"get it" immediately. I certainly didn't get it at first.

Many a bitcoiner's [journey] can be summed up as follows:

1. What the fuck is this?[^fn-tweet]
2. What the fuck is that?
3. What the fuck?
4. The fuck?
5. Fuck\...
6. All in.

The process of understanding and adopting bitcoin is the process of
leaving your fiat self behind. You have to get the fiat memes out of
your head and allow the bitcoin memes in. You have to burn off your fiat
self and build up your bitcoin self. Day by day, action by action, block
by block.

By participating in the system of fiat debt slavery, you reinforce the
meme of instant gratification, of discounting the future for the
present, of fake money and short-term thinking. By participating in the
bitcoin system, you reinforce the meme of sound money, inelastic supply,
long-term thinking, responsibility, and inalienable property rights.

Don't get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with working in the fiat
mines and humbly stacking sats. It's one of the most important things
you can do. Stacking sats will give you freedom, control, and
self-sovereignty. It allows you to maneuver yourself into a position of
stability and strength, and before you know it, the simple act of humbly
stacking and loving your future self will transform you.

The real battle is a personal one. Quelching the impulse of wanting to
have something for nothing. Dropping the habit of immediate
gratification and building up a culture of long-term thinking. Rejecting
impulsive spending, accepting sacrifice and limitation.

The relationship between you and the world is transactional, as John
Dewey taught us. Not only are our physical bodies bound to our physical
environments, but we are also bound to each other via the equally real
economic environments we choose to participate in. And by each dollar
spent and every satoshi saved, we birth our future.

There's a fork in the road. The sign on the one side says: "you'll
own nothing and you'll be happy." The sign on the other side says:
"You'll own bitcoin, and you'll be the best version of yourself."

{% include image.html name="split-stack-sats-vs-debt-slavery.png" caption="The choice is yours." %}

Bitcoin has the power to bring out the best version of yourself because
the incentives of Bitcoin are set up in favor of mutual improvement. On
an individual level, owning bitcoin requires a change in time preference
and responsibility. Ownership implies that you hold your own keys. If
you don't, you don't own bitcoin, but IOUs. It also implies that you
run your own node to verify that you actually hold bitcoin. If you
don't, you're trusting someone else's word for it, relying on their
view of Bitcoin, their worldview, and trusting that they aren't lying
to you.

Even further, continued ownership implies shouldering the responsibility
of providing value to society. Money does nothing but circulate, so you
will have to do something that other people find valuable. If you fail
to do that, you will quickly find yourself out of bitcoin. Nature will
force you to part with your sats, because everyone---including you---
has to eat.

The Bitcoin path is not an easy path, but a fulfilling one. It is
fulfilling because you know the rules, you know the consequences, and
you are in charge. It is a path that allows you to construct a life for
yourself as you see fit, but you'll have to do the constructing. It's
a path that allows you to protect yourself from overreach and theft,
providing long-term security and stability. But you'll have to walk it.
You'll have to participate. You'll have to act it out.

You'll have to burn off your fiat self, leaving behind the easy
answers, the shortcuts, and the fake value. You'll have to provide
something real, be someone real, and suffer the real consequences in
case of failure.

Not only does the line between good and evil run through everyone's
heart, but the line between fiat and bitcoin runs through everyone's
heart too. It's not "us versus them." It's our fiat selves vs. our
bitcoin selves. Personal responsibility vs. willful ignorance. Systemic
fragility vs. long-term stability. You are making a choice with every
action, and you have no choice but to act.

There is a fork in the road, and every single one of us has to decide
which path to take. The seemingly comfortable path presented by the
powers that be, or the bitcoin path: hard, rocky, with its ups and
downs, without safety nets, and without bailouts. It's not an easy
path, but it's a beautiful path. A path that teaches patience,
responsibility, and discipline. A path that will humble you. A
meaningful path. A path that is worth walking.

It used to be a lonely path, but it is not anymore.\\
It used to be a crazy path.

Today, walking down the path of more fiat is the crazy path.
It is a long walk, a daily struggle. And nobody can do the walking but
you. I would love to tell you that I'll meet you at the top, but I'm
afraid there is no top.

I'll meet you on the road instead.
