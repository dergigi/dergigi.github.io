There is much to be said about virtual worlds. The "information
revolution," as it is called, has been going on for multiple decades,
and it should be apparent to everyone that our world is becoming more
digital by the day. 

But what does that mean, exactly? Does it mean that things are
transforming into something that is less real? Will absolutely
everything dematerialize, ourselves included? Is the rapture of the
nerds imminent, and only those who praise the gods of
the singularity will be saved?[^fn-rapture]

[^fn-rapture]: Cory Doctorow (2012), [The Rapture of the Nerds](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Rapture_of_the_Nerds&oldid=1082818012)

I hope not. While it is true that software is eating the
world,[^fn-software] we have to differentiate between
the *digital* and the *virtual*.

[^fn-software]:  Marc Andreessen (2011), [Why Software Is Eating the World](https://archive.ph/8biiK)

## Digital vs. Virtual

As any dictionary will tell you, *digital* is anything that can be
expressed as *digits*, i.e. any information that can be represented in
discrete numerical form. In our modern world of binary encoding, that
means everything that can be encoded as zeros and ones.

> digital, adjective —
> (1) (of signals or data) expressed in discrete numerical form, especially for
> use by a computer or other electronic device.

Not everything that is digital is also virtual. A digital radio is not a
virtual radio, it just works differently than an analog radio. Once said
radio is put into a computer game, however, it clearly becomes
a *virtual* radio.

> virtual, adjective —
> (1) existing or resulting in essence or effect though not in actual fact,
> form, or name.
> (2) created, simulated, or carried on by means of a computer or computer
> network.
> (3) not physically existing as such but made by software to appear to do so

According to one dictionary definition, *virtual* is "anything that is
existing or resulting in *essence* or *effect*, though not
in *actual* fact or form."[^fn-virtual-dictionary] A virtual
meeting room is not an actual meeting room, but it has the *effect* of
one. It is made of bits and bytes as opposed to brick and mortar, but
the meetings that are being held in it, the conversations that are being
had, and the decisions that are being made, are still real.
The *space* is virtual---what happens in it is not.

[^fn-virtual-dictionary]: Definition of '[virtual](https://archive.ph/TmLYL)' from The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 5th Edition.

As we shall see, digital money can and will emerge in virtual worlds. In
fact, it has emerged many times, in multiple worlds and various forms.
To paraphrase Charles Stross: build a world that facilitates trade, and
money will emerge. 

## Virtual Scarcity

As we have seen in Chapter 4, humans have used a multitude of objects as
money over the millennia: cattle, salt, shells, bones, pearls, stones,
copper, bronze, silver, gold, and other precious metals. While the list
of historical monies is long, there is one trait that all functioning
monies share: scarcity. After all, if something is extremely easy to
find or produce, it isn't good money, or at least not for long.

Digital goods aren't naturally scarce. The marginal cost to replicate
them is practically zero, as anyone who ever copy-and-pasted something
can attest to. For this reason, digital scarcity used to be an oxymoron.
If something is digital, it is just information, and information can be
easily copied. 

Before Bitcoin, all digital scarcity was *scarcity by
authority*---authority that can be circumvented or exploited. It was
always *simulated* scarcity. Virtual, not real. 

Without the limitations of physics, digital goods necessitate that a
central authority regulates the issuance, access, and duplication of
said digital goods. If access isn't regulated, anyone can simply take
the information that represents this digital good and make copies of it
(or, sometimes even more problematic: change it). It doesn't matter if
it is the bits and bytes that define the balance of your bank account,
the books in your Kindle, the movies in your Netflix library, the songs
in your Spotify playlists, or the items in your favorite video game. If
access isn't centrally controlled, people will change things to their
advantage. They will update the balance of their bank account and modify
in-game items to make their character more powerful. In other words:
they will cheat. Digital goods are just information, and information
wants to be free---as the unsinkable ships of *Pirate Bay* and endless
leaks and data breaches clearly show. Building a cage around information
is anything but easy.

To get a better understanding of digital goods and their scarcity (or
lack thereof) we will take a look at the virtual worlds that first
spawned them: online games.

## A Short History Of Virtual Economies

In-game economies are almost as old as networked gaming itself. In 1995,
Julian Dibbell published *MUD Money* [^fn-mud],
which describes how money was introduced in Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs).
Coins would appear randomly in these online worlds, so if you stroll
around for long enough you would, over time, find enough money to pay
for certain goods and services in these games. Randall Farmer, a
researcher at MIT who studied the emergence of virtual economies at this
time, describes how in a game called *Habitat* "players could acquire
[\...] funds by engaging in business, winning contests, finding buried
treasure, and so on." He details how players would get a certain amount
of tokens every time they log in, and how "they could spend their
tokens on, among other things, various items for sale in vending
machines called *Vendroids*. There were also Pawn Machines, which would
buy objects back (at a discount, of course)."

[^fn-mud]: Julian Dibbell (1995), [MUD Money](https://web.archive.org/web/20070816070650/http://www.juliandibbell.com/texts/mudmoney.html): A Talk on Virtual Value and, Incidentally, the Value of the Virtual

{% include image.html name="adventure-mud-dark.png" caption="'Colossal Cave Adventure' created by Will Crowther in 1975 was one of the first dungeon games."%}

Money, gold, points, tokens, and coins are constant companions in almost
all games. Come to think of it, most of the games that we now consider
classics have money-like objects in their virtual worlds: Mario has his
coins, Sonic has his rings, and almost every final boss will drop
precious items or heaps of gold once he is slain. In RPGs in particular,
no matter what kind of creatures you are fighting, you will probably
have to acquire gold to upgrade your weapons and armor. 

However, when it comes to single-player games, the digital coins you
collect are worthless. But once an exchange is facilitated
via *networked* play, things start to get interesting. Players will
inevitably trade the virtual treasures they collected over time, whether
there are official trading mechanisms in the game or not. All that is
required is that the stuff that is found and sold stays around, i.e.
that the shared world is *persistent*.

If a world is shared and persistent, real money and real economies can
emerge. While there are many games that had (and still have) vast
virtual economies, I want to highlight three in particular: *Ultima
Online*, *Diablo 2, and Second Life*.

## Ultima Online: Planning a Virtual Economy

Ultima Online was released on September 24, 1997, by Origin Systems. It
was one of the first MMORPGs[^fn-mmorpg] that garnered mainstream attention,
attracting over 100,000 players within six months. Like the MUDs before
it, the world of Ultima Online is a *persistent* world, which means that
your actions and interactions in the game have lasting consequences for
yourself and other players. In stark contrast to single-player games or
non-persistent multiplayer games, you can not "save" the state of your
game and "load" it at a later point. Everything happens in real time,
with real consequences for real people. Consequently, the time and
effort players put into leveling up their characters and gathering items
and resources are real as well, which, in turn, spawn real economies
around these virtual goods.

[^fn-mmorpg]: Massively multiplayer online role-playing game.

To quote Zachary Booth Simpson who studied the in-game economics of the game
extensively: "_Ultima Online_, and online games similar to it, offer a unique
research platform because, while the commodities traded are virtual, the
resulting economies are not simulations.”[^fn-zachary] Matthew Beller from the
Mises Institute echoes this sentiment: "Some economists might dismiss virtual
worlds as an application for economics, given that they do not contain any
resources that are traditionally considered scarce (lumber, steel, oil, etc.),
but a closer inspection reveals that some virtual worlds contain real market
economies complete with scarce resources, property rights, entrepreneurship, and
exchange."[^fn-mises]

[^fn-zachary]: Zachary Booth Simpson (1999), [The In-game Economics of Ultima Online][uo-economics], Origin Research

[uo-economics]: {{ '/assets/files/UO-Economics.pdf' | absolute_url }}

[^fn-mises]: Matthew Beller (2007), [The Coming Second Life Business Cycle](https://archive.ph/6soMH)

The world of Ultima Online allows for spontaneous economic interaction between
players. Players are free to trade as they see fit, directly, without
restriction in regards to what to trade or with whom. However, some parts of the
game's economy are planned by the game's designers. For example, players can
sell their goods to NPCs[^fn-npc], receiving gold in return. Also, players can
explore the world and harvest natural resources, e.g. hunt wild animals for fur
and meat, cut down trees to gather wood, and so on. Naturally, these
computer-controlled aspects of the game have to be pre-programmed: how much of a
good is an NPC vendor willing to buy, and for what price? How many rabbits spawn
in a certain area? How quickly will a forest regrow?

[^fn-npc]: Non-player characters.

{% include image.html name="uo-economic-flow-dark.png" caption="Originally designed and revised economic flow of Ultima Online."%}

As always, human players were quick to find patterns that could be
exploited. To gain the maximum benefit from exploiting these patterns,
many players used macros and scripts to automate what would otherwise be
tedious tasks. For example, players would automate the production of
goods that netted a laudable profit when sold to NPCs, enabling them to
earn money while they slept. And since NPCs would buy anything as long
as they had money, players were able to earn more money more easily than
the game designers had anticipated, thanks to human ingenuity and
automation. To prevent this overproduction, the game designers
interfered by limiting the number of items an NPC would buy per hour. Of
course, this had some unintended consequences, one of which is described
in Simpson's 1999 research paper: "In order to facilitate these
shopkeeper changes, the AI which required the shopkeepers to keep a
positive cash flow had to be abandoned. Shopkeepers now effectively
print gold in order to pay for the useless goods which are being created
by the manufacturers." Sounds familiar?

As history shows and this example illustrates, planning an economy -
virtual or not - is an impossible task. Every interference, no matter
how benign the central planners believe it to be, will have unintended
consequences and side effects that will beget more interference. If the
rules that are supposed to prevent unauthorized copying can be broken
they will be broken, whether it is by the players or the gods that
control the worlds they inhabit. As we will see over and over again, if
the rules are untethered from the physical world, exploits will be
found, rules will be changed, and economies will suffer. 

Ultima Online is no exception, as Simpson points out: "In the early
stages of UO, players discovered an obscure server fault which allowed
them to clone certain kinds of items, primarily gold and reagents.
Although the programmers discovered this cheat quickly, it took them a
long time to fix it. In the interim, the existing UO worlds became
saturated with gold. Estimates of the inflation value range from
multiples of hundreds of thousands to millions. The hyperinflation
destroyed the gold economy and players resorted to bartering and just
plain-old charity during this period."

The same story plays out over and over again, no matter if the worlds
are virtual or not. If someone finds a way to create more money cheaply,
they inevitably will exploit this advantage, no matter the long-term
consequences. As we shall see, this is also true if the money emerges
naturally in the first place.

## Diablo 2: Duplicating the Stone of Jordan

To me, Diablo 2 is one of the great iconic games of PC game history.
Released in the summer of 2000 it quickly became one of the
fastest-selling games to date, selling over a million copies in the
first two weeks. I purchased my copy on the day the game launched (June
29th) and ended up playing it for thousands of hours. Alone, with
friends, at LAN parties, and online. Oh, the good old times.

Similar to Ultima Online before it, Diablo 2 is an RPG. You can play in
groups (parties) with other players, slay monsters, hunt for loot, and
trade items with others. While Diablo 2 has an in-game currency in the
form of gold, gold isn't used to facilitate trade. The reason is that
the gold that players will find in the game is *horrible* money. First
of all, the amount of gold a player can possess is capped. Your
character can only carry 10,000 gold per level, and your stash
(basically your treasure chest) can only hold between 50,000 and
2,500,000 gold, also depending on your level. Second of all, every time
you die a certain percentage of your gold will disappear. This death
penalty will cost you up to 20% of your gold, no matter where you store
it. It simply vanishes, removing itself from circulation. And third of
all, gold isn't particularly scarce. You will find it everywhere, and
every NPC vendor will gladly buy whatever junk you have and give you
gold for it.

All these peculiar properties make Diablo's in-game gold horrible
money. Consequently, a natural, de-facto money emerged: the *Stone of
Jordan*. 

{% include image.html name="soj.jpg" caption="Emergent in-game money: The Stone of Jordan"%}

The Stone of Jordan, or SoJ for short, was one of the _unique_[^fn-unique]
(read: very rare) rings in the game. While it had desirable properties in and of
itself, most players didn't use it as an item to be equipped, but as a currency
to facilitate trade. The SoJ was small and rare, which made it portable and
valuable.[^fn-soj-monopoly] Using up only one slot in a player's inventory, many
players had dozens of SoJs in their stash to be used for trading. Prices emerged
naturally.[^fn-soj-endogenous] Most desirable weapons—which usually belonged to
the unique or set class—traded for single-digit amounts of SoJs. A _Doombringer_
sword was worth between two and four SoJs, an _Eaglehorn_ bow between five and
seven, and a mallet known as _Schaefer's Hammer_ was worth between four and six
SoJs. Any item that was worth less than a single SoJ was traded for one or more
_perfect skulls_, another de-facto currency that emerged naturally. In essence,
the perfect skull was the $1 bill of the game, and the SoJ was the $5 bill of
the game. Naturally, one SoJ would trade for 5 perfect skulls. Only the best
items were priced in the double digits in terms of SoJs. One example would be
the _Windforce_ bow that, coincidentally, my _Bowazon_ was lucky enough to hold
in her hands. It was traded for around 40 SoJs.

[^fn-soj-endogenous]: Salter, A. W., & Stein, S. (2016). [Endogenous currency formation in an online environment: The case of Diablo II.][d2-currency-formation] The Review of Austrian Economics, 29(1), 53-66.

[d2-currency-formation]: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11138-014-0289-1

[^fn-unique]: Unique items in Diablo 2 aren't unique in the literal sense, but belong to the "unique" class. Other classes are normal, superior, magic, rare, set, and crafted. Unique items are exceedingly rare, meaning that the odds that they will spawn more than once each game are nearly impossible.

The *Stone of Jordan* eventually lost its role as the de-facto money in
Diablo 2. As with all obsolete money, its eventual downfall was that
people found a way to make more of it, cheaply. 

Inflation began gradually. Since the *Stone of Jordan* was such a valuable item,
players began to "farm" it as best as they could. They found all kinds of
ingenious ways to make it "drop" more often, inflating the supply over
time.[^fn-fiat-farming] The game developers even introduced features into the
game that would incentivize players to get rid of the additional SoJ supply. For
example: if enough players sold their SoJ rings to NPC vendors, a special
monster would spawn, known as the *Uber Diablo - *a clone of the final boss of
the game. 

[^fn-fiat-farming]: It is worth pointing out at this point that our current fiat monies such as the USD can be farmed too. The easiest way to farm fiat is not by doing work, however, but by taking on debt.

Of course, the cheapest way to make more of something is not to farm it,
but to copy it. And that's exactly what players figured out to do.
People found ways to exploit certain bugs in the game and its servers,
allowing them to duplicate any item of their choosing. These *dupes*, as
they became to be known, were perfect copies of the original item. In
essence, players found a way to double-spend their digital items,
leaving the game's servers and other players none the wiser.

It didn't take long for the in-game economy to collapse. As one player
recounts: "On June 30, 2003, several key developers left Blizzard North
to form new companies. By now the SoJ economy was in ruins [\...]. I
remember well the day when it all collapsed, prices had been inflating
ever so slightly for several weeks and when I logged on that morning to
do business as usual the trade channel was in a state of chaos.
Stormshields were going for 20 SoJ, other higher value items were
impossible to obtain. The heydays were over and everyone knew it. The
once busy trade channels would slowly fade to silence\..."

Eventually, the game developers were able to get a handle on the
situation. Most of the bugs that allowed for this duplication to happen
were fixed, and systems were put in place to identify dupes and destroy
them. Of course, this destructive process wreaked even more havoc on the
whole economy, at least in the short term. Many players didn't know if
their items were dupes or not, so imagine waking up one day to see that
half of your possessions simply vanished overnight.

Over time, other forms of money emerged. The expansion pack "Lord of
Destruction" introduced *rune words* into the game, and with the duping
brought somewhat under control, the runes that were the atomic
components of these words eventually became the new de-facto money. They
share all the monetary properties that the SoJ had, and additionally,
they varied in rarity. This led to runes effectively becoming the \$1,
\$5, \$10, \$20, and \$50 notes of the game.

With the release of Diablo 3 in 2012, the legend of the *Stone of
Jordan* lived on. As a nod to its monetary use in the previous
incarnation of the game series, the developers added the following
sentence to the lore surrounding the ring: *"The Stone of Jordan is far
more valuable than its appearance would suggest. Men have given much to
possess it."*

Once people hone in on one form of money, they do indeed go through
great pains to gather more of the precious good. What's true for gold
and diamonds in meatspace is also true for *Stones of Jordan* and other
rare items in cyberspace. As we shall see, this is also true for
artificially scarce goods such as designer clothes and other luxury
items.

## Second Life: Linden Lab's Interventionism

Launched in 2003, the virtual world of Second Life quickly became an
economic phenomenon. Second Life differs from the games mentioned
previously since it isn't necessarily a game in the first place. You
don't hunt monsters and go on quests, you are simply a resident of a
virtual world. It is an alternative place to meet and do things, a world
where you can be anything and anyone you want to be. In other words: it
is an opportunity to start a second life.

Residents of Second Life craft all kinds of virtual goods: clothing,
vehicles, houses, sculptures, gadgets, artwork - anything that can be
modeled in 3D. Residents can buy cosmetics to improve the appearance of
their avatars, just like we do in the real world. Skin, hair, jewelry,
custom animations - if you can imagine it, someone will craft it and
sell it to you. Apart from objects, some focus on providing services for
their fellow residents: entertainment, education, consulting, business
management, news, and yes, even banking.

As a consequence, many people ditched their real-life job to focus fully
on their *Second Life* job. While the goods might be virtual, the
profits are not, and it didn't take long for the first self-made
millionaires of Second Life to emerge. In 2006, Anshe Chung (known as
Ailin Graef in her first life) became the first person to make over one
million US dollars in Second Life. It took her two and a half years to
build her fortune, mainly working in the virtual real estate business.

In 2009, the total size of the _Second Life_ economy grew to USD 567 million,
with gross resident earnings of USD 55 million. As of this
writing,[^fn-this-writing] Second Life has about 50,000 residents logged into
the virtual world at any given time, and an annual GDP of approximately USD 500
million.[^fn-sl-facts] To quote Matthew Beller: "Second Life's economy could
reasonably be compared to that of a small foreign country dependent on
tourism."[^fn-mises]

[^fn-this-writing]: Daniel Voyager (2022). [Second Life Grid Statistics](https://archive.ph/oWcuX)

[^fn-sl-facts]: Nick Galov (2022). [Second Life in 2022: What It Means to Live in a Virtual World](https://archive.ph/Br8Dh)

In the game itself, however, it is not US dollars that are circulating.
The currency in Second Life is the Linden dollar (L\$), named after
Linden Lab, the company that created Second Life. Residents can acquire
Linden dollars by parting with their real dollars on an exchange
provided by Linden Lab.

Even though the exchange rate between the Linden dollar and the US
dollar isn't fixed, the "God" in this economy is still Linden Lab.
The company controls all aspects of the game from monetary policy to
physics to what is allowed in what region and who gets to be a resident
and who will be banned. In short: Linden Lab has the power to break the
rules and interfere as they see fit. And interfere they did, many
times. 

Most of these "Acts of Linden," as they became known in the community,
were initiated by the company to steer the virtual world in a certain
direction or improve the bottom line of Linden Lab. One such example
would be the introduction of a value-added tax for all European
residents - a tax for purchasing virtual goods, mind you. Others, such
as the global ban on gambling, were initiated because of pressure due to
real-world government regulations.
To quote the announcement of this new policy: "Second Life Residents must comply
with state and federal laws applicable to regulated online gambling, even when
both operators and players of the games reside outside of the US."[^fn-slb]

[^fn-slb]: Robin Linden (2007), [Wagering In Second Life: New Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20071216095626/http://blog.secondlife.com/2007/07/25/wagering-in-second-life-new-policy/), Second Life Blog

As with all complex systems, interference will often cause a whole set
of intricate problems down the line. The ban on gambling, for example,
led to a run on the banks by both players and operators of casinos,
sports betting institutions, and other gambling businesses.
Consequently, one of the largest banks in the game - *Ginko Financial* -
collapsed, since most ATMs located in the gambling districts were owned
by this bank. Residents quickly drained the reserves of the bank since
Ginko Financial operated on a fractional reserve, just like banks in the
real world do. The virtual bank invested its money primarily in illiquid
goods or virtual securities, just like banks in the real world do. It
was later described as a Ponzi scheme, just like \... you get the idea.

Consequently, another "Act of Linden" followed. Linden Lab updated their terms
of services and various policies[^fn-slw] to include a new rule for all
residents of their virtual world: everyone who offers an interest-paying service
in Second Life must have a real-life banking license. The reason? Legal risks.

[^fn-slw]: Linden Lab (2011), [Official Policy Regarding In-World Banks](https://web.archive.org/web/20200507122527/http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Linden_Lab_Official:Policy_regarding_inworld_banks), Second Life Wiki

The following is a direct quote from the Second Life Blog: "As of January 22,
2008, it will be prohibited to offer interest or any direct return on an
investment (whether in L$ or other currency) from any object, such as an ATM,
located in Second Life, without proof of an applicable government registration
statement or financial institution charter. We're implementing this policy after
reviewing Resident complaints, banking activities, and the law, and we're doing
it to protect our Residents and the integrity of our economy."[^fn-slbp]

[^fn-slbp]:  Ken D Linden (2008), [New Policy Regarding In-World “Banks”](https://web.archive.org/web/20080109141057/http://blog.secondlife.com/2008/01/08/new-policy-regarding-in-world-banks/), Second Life Blog

Second Life shows two things very clearly: (1) Artificially regulating a
complex system is not only difficult, but it will almost always have
unintended consequences that might make the problem worse. (2) If you
are a centralized and identifiable entity that has the power to change
the rules, the real-world state will intervene.

There is a lot to be learned from the controlled laboratory experiment that is
Second Life. In many ways, Linden Labs failed to create a stable and controlled
closed-loop economy, even with the godlike powers they have over all aspects of
the game.  As Joseph Potts put it: "whether in real life or the virtual one, the
creation of money by fiat produces booms and busts, and this even in a world in
which the 'government' can and does create (all) value."[^fn-mises-pass]

## Gaming and Virtual Currencies Today

Online games and the in-game economies they create are here to stay. For
those who grew up with computer games, spending money on in-game goods
is as normal as paying for other digital goods and services such as
songs, movies, or ebooks. People will continue to spend ridiculous
amounts of money on cosmetics and status symbols. Whether these goods
exist in "real life" or in virtual worlds does not seem to matter.
Luxurious cars, expensive watches, jewelry, designer clothes - virtual
or not, the money people spend on them is real.

As of today, the most well-known game that monetizes on the purchase of
cosmetic luxuries is probably *Fortnite*. Released in 2017, the
free-to-play game has attracted more than 100 million players and earns
hundreds of millions of dollars per month, mostly by selling in-game
items such as skins, characters, emotes, and so on. Again: these items
are pure cosmetics; they don't improve your character or gameplay in
any way, except for visuals. Some of the rarer skins sell for hundreds
and sometimes even thousands of dollars. They are virtual collectibles
for a digital generation.

The most recent incarnation of Counter-Strike, *Counter-Strike: Global
Offensive*, is another game that sells expensive cosmetics. Being one of
the most popular first-person shooters in the world, the only parts of
your character that you see on the regular are your hands and the weapon
that is held by them. Naturally, cosmetics in *CS:GO* are applied to
what you see: weapons. While most of these weapon skins are almost
worthless, some of the rare ones regularly trade hands for thousands of
dollars on secondary markets. Some skins are bound to championships and
thus have a unique character, such as the *Dragon Lore* from the Boston
2018 Major, which sold for over USD 61,000 in January 2018. Some
collectors seem to have paid even more to purchase a single skin, with
reports citing up to twice that amount (over USD 100,000). [Footnote:

{% include image.html name="dragonlore.png" caption="Dragon Lore AWP skin sold for USD 61,000 in 2018"%}

All of this goes to show that if left to their own devices, players will
spawn vast economies as long as the game mechanics allow for it. One of
the best examples of a flourishing in-game economy is Eve Online, an
MMORPG space simulation. The game was home to what is probably the most
expensive battle in gaming history: the *Bloodbath of
B-R5RB,* (Footnote: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodbath_of_B-R5RB)
named after the star system where the battle took place. Players can
visit 7,800 star systems in this virtual world to explore, mine, trade,
and---of course---combat other players. This particular battle took
place in January 2014. The tally of the losses of all involved was in
the realm of 11 trillion Interstellar Kredit (ISK) or USD 330,000 at the
time. I can only echo the words of Marcus Carter, Kelly Bergstrom, and
Darryl Woodford: *"Internet Spaceships Are Serious
Business."* (Footnote:
https://www.amazon.de/Internet-Spaceships-Are-Serious-Business/dp/0816699089/) 

No discussion about in-game money is complete without mentioning the
king of gold farming, at least in terms of real-world
repercussions: *World of Warcraft*. The virtual gold rush and the gold
farms (Footnote: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming) it spawned
are something to behold. While the gold was virtual, the (mostly
criminal) organizations launched to systematically harvest the in-game
currency were anything but. The idea was simple: hire a bunch of people,
pay them to play for up to 20 hours a day, and sell the gold they find
in the game to other players. For real money, of course. Some took the
execution of this idea to the extreme. "Companies" retro-fitted
warehouses to cram as many PCs and "employees" in them as possible.
The only job of these employees was to play the game and farm gold. In
even more extreme cases prison inmates were forced to farm the digital
asset all night long. As Paul Tassi wrote in Forbes in 2011: "It's
been discovered that in an unknown number of Chinese prisons across the
country, inmates have been forced not only to do physical labor, but
electronic work as well, acting as *World of Warcraft* gold farmers by
night." [Footnote:
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/25/china-prisoners-internet-gaming-scam]
It turns out that prison bosses made more money with forced in-game
labor than they made with good old-fashioned forced physical labor in
the real world. Prisoners were compelled to work 12-hour shifts inside
the game, earning up to USD 900 per day for the prison bosses.
The *China Farmer* phenomenon, as it became to be known in the World of
Warcraft community, was not only an ethical problem but an economic one
as well. Farming is just one method to produce more of something
cheaply, and if that something is money, the effects that come with
inflation will burden the economy; in-game or not.

While in-game economies can have repercussions in the real world, the
reverse is also true: economic events in the real world can have
rippling effects that disturb virtual worlds. One such example is the
hyperinflation in Venezuela, which lead many people to start farming
gold and other valuable in-game items to make ends meet. Venezuelans
that had a computer and internet access were driven to abandon their
real-world jobs, since farming and selling virtual goods to players
worldwide - sometimes using bitcoin as the intermediate medium of
exchange - brought in more money than they could earn regularly. As The
Economist quipped: "The law of supply and demand is ignored in
Venezuela, but not online." [Footnote:
https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/11/21/venezuelas-paper-currency-is-worthless-so-its-people-seek-virtual-gold]
So many Venezuelans farmed and traded virtual goods that when the power
went out during the 2019 Venezuelan blackouts, virtual worlds such
as *RuneScape* suffered their own economic crisis. Imagine a lively
marketplace, and suddenly, one day, the vast majority of traders (and
thus goods) can't show up. After all, there is no online trading when
you're forced to be offline because the power is out.

All these examples show that games are microcosms when it comes to
economies and the creation and control of money. The difference between
the Linden Dollar, World of Warcraft Gold, Fortnite V-Bucks, the Euro,
and the U.S. dollar is in scale, not in nature. While V-Bucks are
created and controlled by Epic Games (the company that created
Fortnite), the U.S. dollar is created and controlled by the Fed. One
impacts millions of people, the other billions. The mechanism that keeps
these monies in check---the rules of the game, if you will---is the same
in both cases: central decree.

## Emergent Money in a Non-Virtual World

Bitcoin is different. Bitcoin's value does not derive from a central
decree. Like gold before it, its scarcity and persistence do not derive
from *authority*, but from *reality*. Gold is scarce because physical
laws make its production extraordinarily costly. Gold doesn't go away
because it is virtually indestructible. 

Bitcoin brings digital objects into existence---sats---that are bound to
the digital world of the bitcoin network. How is this any different from
the various in-game monies that emerged before it?

The difference lies in the *issuance and control* of the monetary units,
which, when centrally controlled, are the source and root of all
monetary evil, as Hayek said so poignantly.

> [Free trade in money] seems to me both preferable and more
practicable than the utopian scheme of introducing a new European
currency, which would ultimately only have the effect of more deeply
entrenching the source and root of all monetary evil, the government
monopoly of the issue and control of money.
>
> <cite>F. A. Hayek</cite> 

The problem of *issuance* relates to the monetary units themselves: who
can make more of them? The problem of *control* relates to the
environment that said monetary units inhabit: who can change the rules?

In very general terms, this problem is always the same. There
are *objects*, and there is the environment that allows these things to
exist: the respective *arena*. In the physical world, we call the
relationship between objects physical laws---because they can't be
broken---and we call the arena the universe. We also have objects and
arenas in the world of gaming: items that make players more powerful,
and the virtual worlds they inhabit. While most in-game monies, such as
the Linden Dollar, are brought about by decree, some in-game monies
emerge naturally, as evidenced by the monetary use of the Stone of
Jordan in Diablo II.

When it comes to fiat money, the arena is the nation-state. The objects
used to be physical: coins and paper notes. Today, they are mostly
virtual: zeroes and ones in a central bank server. In any case, fiat
money is untethered from economic reality. It is a made-up construct,
which is why all fiat monies go away over time. Either the money
collapses due to hyperinflation, or the arena collapses due to the end
of the nation.

{% include image.html name="physical-vs-digital-arena.png" caption="TODO"%}

Whether we look at computer games or fiat money, the questions we have
to ask when it comes to money are the same: Who can create more of it?
Is there a way to farm it effectively? And, most importantly: Who is in
charge of the arena?

History shows that any rules that can be broken will be broken.
Consequently, we can assert the following with confidence: If the
objects are virtual---disconnected from reality---they can be created at
a whim. If there is a mechanism to make more of a desired good---virtual
or not---some ingenious humans will find a way to do so efficiently.
[Footnote: Diamonds come to mind.] If the arena is virtual---if the
environment is disconnected from reality---the rules of the game can be
changed arbitrarily, and, even more catastrophically, the arena can
disappear.

For in-game currencies, this means that the company that is running the
game servers went bankrupt or decided to shut down for other reasons.
For fiat currencies, this means that the nation-state went bankrupt or
ceased to exist.

As a shorthand, we might call the aforementioned questions
print/farm/serve, short for: Can it be printed? Can it be farmed? Is it
served? If the answer to any of these questions is *yes*, then you are
most definitely dealing with bad money.

When looking at the trifecta of print/farm/serve through the lens of
Bitcoin, most people will know by now that only 21 million will ever
exist, i.e. that you can't print it. Fewer people will understand the
difficulty adjustment, which is the mechanism that allows Bitcoin's
monetary issuance to be fixed in time, i.e. the mechanism that makes the
efficient farming of bitcoin impossible. Only very few will understand
the last part: the fact that Bitcoin isn't served, that it arises out
of your personal view, and the overlap of this view with others. Most
skeptics still believe that Bitcoin will go away just like all the
virtual worlds that came before it.

The skeptics are right to be skeptical. Ephemerality is one trait that
all virtual worlds share, along with the virtual monies that exist in
them: they all go away, eventually. After all, they are *virtual*, not
real. They are simulations: made-up constructs, a cheap imitation of
reality.

How is Bitcoin different?

## Digital Reality

> Reality is that which,
> when you stop believing in it,
> doesn't go away. 
>
> <cite>Philip K. Dick</cite>

While the world of Bitcoin is a digital world, it is not a virtual
world. It is not a made-up world. Yes, the rules were "made up" by
Satoshi---but they are neither arbitrary nor can they be changed
arbitrarily. More importantly, the world that arises out of these rules
is *not* virtual. It is *not* a simulated world. It requires real cost,
real time, real energy---and, consequently---real sacrifice to maintain
itself. It is not a world by decree; it is a non-virtual world that
arises out of the manipulation of bits and bytes. A shared view of past
events, rooted in the physical and mathematical laws of our universe.

Bitcoin is not a simulation. Consequently, the digital scarcity of
bitcoin is not virtual. It arises out of real, *physical* limits. The
rules of Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment do not *simulate* physical
laws, they are brought into existence *because of* physical laws.

Bitcoin consists of numbers. For this reason, it might be tempting to
discuss the metaphysical question of whether numbers are real or not,
and plenty of philosophical ink was spilled in attempts to answer this
question. I will refrain from trying to answer the question of what
ultimately constitutes reality. Is it particles? Strings? Fields?
Information? Interaction? Connection? Value?

Whatever reality is, Bitcoin maps onto it.

Bitcoin does not care about the answers to these metaphysical questions.
It is a pragmatic solution that does not care whether numbers are real
or not. A practical solution that works independently of metaphysical
speculations of reality. Bitcoin's realness does not arise out of the
realness of numbers, but out of the realness of computation, which is to
say out of the realness of *energy*. There is no way to do computation
without expending energy. The physical laws of our universe forbid it.
It is this limitation that is at the root of all cryptography.

Cryptography is the exploitation of this law via the application of
mathematical extremes. At the extremes, the mathematical becomes
physical. In theory, you could guess Satoshi's private key. And yet it
is virtually impossible in practice. In theory, you could mine a hundred
valid bitcoin blocks in five seconds. Yet, again, it is virtually
impossible in practice.

Bitcoin is not a simulation because certain bits can only be brought
about by expensive physical processes. These processes can not be
simulated, because they are rooted in computation itself. There is no
shortcut to these computations, which is why the physics inherent in
computation---the very physical process of flipping bits---is undeniably
embedded in the information that is produced.

The randomness of proof-of-work is a feature, not a bug. There is no
progress towards a solution. There are no shortcuts and there can't be
any shortcuts. Randomness is what makes it fair and resistant to
cheating. Remove this randomness, and you are back at something that is
given by decree. Remove the difficulty adjustment, and you are back at
something that can be farmed.

The only way to produce a valid proof-of-work is to actually do the
work. This is what makes Bitcoin real; this is what transfers the
physical limits of our universe into the digital world of Bitcoin. This
is what makes Bitcoin more than a fancy telephone; Bitcoin doesn't only
connect people, but it uses proof-of-work to connect itself to the
physical world.

{% include image.html name="chain-to-the-physical.png" caption="TODO"%}

Proof-of-work can't be argued with. The information that is brought
into existence via proof-of-work can only exist because certain things
happened in the real world. Certain events that are so improbable, so
incredibly unlikely, that they had to happen in *actuality*, even though
every single event was a *digital* event.

>
> <cite>Satoshi Nakamoto</cite>

Bitcoin's difficulty-adjusted proof-of-work is what makes Bitcoin a
real phenomenon, something to be wrestled with. It is what makes it
non-virtual, non-imaginary. 

The numbers that make a valid block valid are too improbable to be
dreamt up by anyone. They can only exist because real people invested
real time and real energy---using real machinery---to bring them about.
The numbers might be random, but the process that brings them about is
not. The parameters might be arbitrary, but the digital universe they
create is not.

## Emergent Money in an Emergent World

One question remains: why won't Bitcoin die? Why doesn't it go away?
To answer this, we have to talk about two other aspects of the
proof-of-work coin: *validation* and *instantiation*.

If you are the inhabitant of someone else's world---if the arena is
"served"---you will always be bound to their rules. That is true in
computer games and nation-states alike. The game changes if you can
"run your own," which is what makes you independent of any masters. If
you run your own instance---if you create your own world---you won't
have to bow down to anyone else. You just have to subjugate yourself to
the laws of nature.

In Bitcoin, anyone can create both the *objects* and the *arena*. Anyone
can mine. Anyone can run a node.

A node is what builds up and verifies the digital world of Bitcoin, from
the very beginning, including all rules and all past states. The world
of Bitcoin arises out of the overlap of all these individual worlds. It
is not a shared world, it is a world of consensus that arises out
of *agreement*. Agreement about what happened in the past; agreement via
independent repetition of the same experiment and arriving at the same
conclusion.

A "miner" is what extends the digital world of Bitcoin. Miners are in
the business of block production, which is to say in the business of
proposing a new block of past events to the network. If the events are
in accordance with the rules, nodes will accept them. If they are not,
nodes will reject them. Miners extend the arena, and in doing so, are
rewarded with sats---the most precious objects in the world of Bitcoin.
Anyone can participate in block production. All that is required is an
energy source and a communications channel.

Herein lies the main difference when compared to fiat and in-game money:
you don't have to rely on anyone to bring Bitcoin about. You can do it
all yourself.

Bitcoin is here to stay because it is cheap and easy to bring into
existence. It is a networked phenomenon that emerges out of equal peers,
not unlike electricity and the internet before it. The fear of Bitcoin
ceasing to exist arises out of a deep misunderstanding of the nature of
these phenomena. It is akin to asking: "What if electricity goes
away?"

Electricity isn't a magical thing given to us by the high priests of
the Ministry of Electrons. Take a magnet, take a copper wire, and voilà!
You have electricity. Anyone can generate electricity at all times, as
long as they are doing the required work. Electricity is here to stay
precisely because it is *not* brought about by authority. It is
a *natural* phenomenon, brought about by physical interaction. There is
no central authority in charge when it comes to making it. 

Networked computing won't go away either, and for the same reason. Take
two computers, plug them together, and voilà! You have a network. Plug
many networks together, and voilà! You have the internet. The thing
about the internet is that it's most useful when it's largest, which
is why we have one internet, not many. [Footnote: We used to have many,
but it clearly is a winner-takes-all phenomenon.]

The same goes for Bitcoin: run free and open-source software on your
computer, connect it to another node with compatible consensus rules,
and voilà! You have Bitcoin. 

By running consensus software you decide which rules are important to
you. In other words: you decide what Bitcoin is, and it is you who
brings it about---both philosophically, and technically. There are no
servers. You create your own world. And if you're lucky, your view of
the world will overlap sufficiently so that you can communicate and
trade with others. You are free to extend this world, both in accordance
with the rules (block production) and by introducing new rules (forks).
If your rule change is incompatible, your world will cease to overlap
with the worlds of others, leaving you stranded on an island of one.
[Footnote: We will discuss soft- and hard forks in detail in Chapter
16.]

{% include image.html name="emergent-world-vs-dictate.png" caption="TODO"%}

Unlike most virtual worlds, the world of Bitcoin arises out of the
intersection of individual points of view. It is not served by authority
but emerges organically out of the agreement of equal peers. The
extension of this digital world is physical and costly. Verification is
mathematical and cheap. It is this asymmetry that brings about the game
theory that keeps everything in balance. 

As long as someone cares about fair, censorship-resistant money that is
independent of the state, Bitcoin will exist. Even if that someone is
only one person. Even if that someone is just you.

## Conclusion

Before Bitcoin, all digital money was *virtual* money. Most virtual
monies are fiat monies, only money because some authority says so. Even
when money emerged naturally in networked games, the worlds that form
these arenas were always *virtual* worlds, designed, controlled, and
maintained by central authorities. Authorities with the power to change
the rules, something that they will always do, either out of
self-interest or emergency. As we have seen, if a central authority can
be identified, the state will step in and force a rule change.

The difference between in-game money and fiat money is in scale, not in
nature. Both are virtual: simulations that are untethered from reality.
And with the introduction of CBDCs, both will be completely digital as
well.

Bitcoin is the first money that is digital but not virtual. Before
Bitcoin, any link between the digital and the physical was always rooted
in trust and human intepretation, not physical reality. Bitcoin's link
to the real world is defined by numbers and their mathematical
relationships; relationships so extreme, that they can only be brought
about by real events in the real world. Consequently, the processes in
Bitcoin are not subject to opinion or interpretation. They are not a
simulation, which is why Bitcoin can't be paused, restarted, or
stopped.

The metaphysical properties of Bitcoin are independent of the
metaphysical nature of numbers. The fact that Bitcoin is "just
numbers" is unimportant. What is important is the process that brings
about these numbers, which is a process that can't be faked, cheated,
or simulated. We know, without a doubt, that the only way to bring a
valid bitcoin block into existence is by expending real energy in the
real world. 

Jaron Lanier quipped that "information is not something that exists."
I disagree. Information that can only exist because of expensive
physical processes has a certain reality to it. It is inconvertible
proof that something happened in the real world. It is "more real"
than the words that you are currently reading. After all, this paragraph
could've been cheaply generated by GPT-3. A valid bitcoin block? Not so
much.

Bitcoin creates a digital world that, at first glance, might be compared
to the virtual worlds of computer games. What we call "sats" can be
understood as endogenous items of the Bitcoin game. As we have seen
in [Chapter 3](https://21-ways.com/3/), sats had no monetary value for
the first 10 months. The moneyness of sats had to emerge over time,
which is what makes bitcoin *natural* money, not fiat money. Sats have
all the properties that are required of good money---which is why they
are used as money, just like the Stone of Jordan was natural money in
the virtual world of Diablo II, and gold was natural money in the
physical world. However, unlike the Stone of Jordan, sats can be
instantiated by anyone, which is what makes them persistent. And unlike
gold, sats are natively digital.

When it comes to money, two questions are of utmost importance: (1) Who
has the authority to create it? (2) Can the mechanism of money creation
be abused?

When it comes to digital money, a third question needs to be answered:
Who is in charge of the arena? 

In the virtual worlds of computer games and fiat monies, whoever is
running the servers is in charge. In Bitcoin, it is *you* and you alone
who is in charge. You and the truth are the final authority, brought
about by mathematics and the physical laws of our universe.

The three questions of print/farm/serve also point to the reasons why
digital monies failed in the past, and why CBDCs will fail in the
future: 

1.  "admins" abused their powers and printed more outright, 
2.  "players" found a way to make more of it cheaply, 
3.  "the arena" ceases to exist, either because of bankruptcy or state
    intervention.

The combination of non-simulatable proof-of-work with cheap, independent
verification and instantiation is what separates Bitcoin from all the
monies that came before it. 

Bitcoin creates a *digital* arena, not a virtual one. It is defined by
reality, not authority. The use of sats as money emerged naturally, not
by decree. Bitcoin's arena is instantiated by individuals who are
voluntarily agreeing to a set of rules, as opposed to virtual worlds
that are instantiated by rulers who dictate the rules for all.

Bitcoin is scarce because time and energy are scarce. The issuance of
sats is related to *time*, not energy. The energy cost is dynamic and
completely unrelated to issuance. More energy won't produce more
bitcoin, it will only disperse the bitcoin that would be issued anyway
more widely while making the Bitcoin network more secure. As we have
seen in Chapter 3, the fact that block production requires electricity
is a feature, not a bug. It acts as an unforgeable costly signal that is
used to build up a trustless arrow of time, as well as a transparent and
publicly verifiable shield around the past. It is an anti-cheat
mechanism to ensure that the past can't be altered cheaply and to
ensure that future issuance can't be farmed efficiently.* *

Consequently, Bitcoin's energy consumption is not a byproduct of the
creation of sats, but a by-product of demand for a fair distribution of
sats. If the demand for sats had stayed with Satoshi and Satoshi alone,
Bitcoin's energy use would be close to zero. If it would've stayed
like this for all of Bitcoin's bootstrapping phase, Satoshi would have
had 100% of the initial coin distribution. After the bootstrapping
phase, it will still be about the fair distribution of sats, but the
sats will be paid, not issued. Energy use is thus related to
decentralization and security, nothing else.

In short: bitcoin can't be printed because it is automatically issued
over time. The system can't be cheated because energy can't be copied.
Proof-of-work can't be simulated, and the difficulty adjustment forbids
the "farming" of blocks. Anyone can participate in, instantiate, and
validate everything.

Bitcoin is a digital item in a digital environment, brought about and
kept alive by physical processes. It is the combination of the physical
with the digital that gives Bitcoin its power: a digital commodity that
can be sent around at the speed of light, inexorably linked to the
physical laws of our universe. It is *digital* gold, not virtual gold.

Virtual currencies like in-game currencies and fiat currencies are not
scarce, because they do neither require time nor energy to create.
God-like entities can create them out of thin air. This is true even if
money emerges naturally in a virtual arena, as was the case in Diablo
II. As long as the arena is virtual, it can be controlled and shut down.
The difference between central banks and game developers is one of
quantity, not quality.

The downside of gold is that it is a physical item in a physical
environment. You can't teleport it, and therein lies the problem.
Bitcoin is a scarce digital commodity that, monetarily speaking, is as
valuable as a scarce physical commodity, precisely because it is issued
and secured by a physical process. Proof-of-work reifies Bitcoin's
blocks as well as the monetary units within them, and it is this
reification of information that allows Bitcoin to transcend the mere
virtual.

But Bitcoin transcends more than just the virtual. It also transcends
all other monies that came before it, by introducing something that
cannot be improved upon further, something that did not and *can
not* exist in the physical world: absolute limitation via zero terminal
inflation.

21 million. Absolute scarcity.
