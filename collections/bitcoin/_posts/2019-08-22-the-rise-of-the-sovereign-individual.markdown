Not too long ago, the internet was a fringe phenomenon. Very few people
saw the benefits of a global communications network. Even fewer people
had the vision and the foresight to see what it might enable. Today,
most people take the internet for granted. It is simply expected to be
there, like running water in your home.

Even before the internet became ubiquitous, technologists and
visionaries realized the potential of this transformative technology.
They realized that an undiscriminating network combined with the magical
power of public-key cryptography tips the power-balance in the
individual's favor.

Eavesdropping-resistant communication which can't be stopped is poison
to authoritarian regimes, which, after all, are in the business of
suppressing and controlling the flow of information. If people are still
able to communicate and assemble, they can rise up and speak truth to
power. We saw the liberating potential of communications technology
during the Arab Spring, and we continue to see individuals rise up and
fight authoritarian rule today.

What the cypherpunks understood 30 years ago is starting to play out
right before our eyes: the tools of our information age have the
potential to empower individuals like never before.

### The Freedom to Transact

As I am writing these lines, hundreds of thousands of people are
marching in the streets of Hong Kong, protesting against an extradition
bill proposed by the government. As always, protests like these shine a
light on the current power balance between individuals and the powers
that be.

Unfortunately, the current system of surveillance, automated facial
recognition, and cashless transfers enables not only a single point of
failure, but also a single point of control in times of unrest. If the
government doesn't like your opinion or the fact that you were part of a
(peaceful) protest, a simple truth becomes apparent: your freedom of
assembly was an illusion, as was your freedom to transact freely.

In a free society, these freedoms should be guaranteed. How? Well, as we have
seen in the past, information technology and strong cryptography --- if used
carefully --- *guarantee* the right to speak freely. After all, [no amount of
violence will ever solve a math problem][math-problem]. In the same vein, an
information technology exists today which *guarantees* the right to transact
freely: Bitcoin.

It is easy to forget that "permissionless" and "censorship-resistant"
are more than mere buzzwords. Under difficult circumstances, these words
become a matter of life and death. The Hong Kong protests make evident
once again what privacy advocates have been preaching for years, even
decades: if censorship and surveillance are built into the system, it
will be used and abused by those who are in charge. And if you don't
have the option to detach from your identity, free speech, free thought,
and free action are impossible.

What is true for WeChat, Facebook, and Google, is also true for our
current payment rails and the financial institutions of this world. No
matter how noble the motivation of building central controls into
communication or financial systems --- power corrupts, and absolute
power corrupts absolutely, as the saying goes.

Strong cryptography allows us to reclaim our right to private
conversations in the digital age, thanks to end-to-end encryption. The
same cryptography allows us to reclaim our right to transact freely in a
digital world, thanks to digital signatures, cryptographic hashes, and
the global machine of truth and freedom which is Bitcoin.

### The Freedom to Remain Private

In today's digital world --- as Hong Kong protesters know --- finding
out who went to which protest is as easy as retrieving data from a
database. Whether it is from people's bank accounts, WeChat, Alipay, or
other virtual profiles, the convenience of the status quo inevitably
leads to a system of total surveillance, and thus total control.

The solution to this conundrum is enabling privacy by default, which has
been the default setting for thousands of years. Neither the internet
nor Bitcoin is perfect in this regards, which is why constant vigilance
and the development of privacy-enhancing technology are a necessity.

In the last couple of years, efforts to encrypt all internet traffic by
default have been made. In the next couple of years, we hope to see
continued efforts being made to make every bitcoin transaction even more
private than they are now (which is one of the reasons why [Bull Bitcoin
uses Wasabi's CoinJoin by default]).

As is [evidenced][maryhui] by the long lines at Hong Kong's train ticketing
machines, surveillance renders all other freedoms useless.

The current situation in Hong Kong paints a vivid picture of the
disastrous side-effects of a cashless society. Without a way to transact
privately and anonymously, people are enslaved to the masters of
finance. And no amount of [going digitally dark] will allow you to avoid
this slavery.

Arguably, things are bound to go from bad to worse. The financial elite
which controls the most important good of our society --- money itself
--- is playing god with our shared macroeconomic reality. In the last
couple of decades, a concerted effort was made to attack another
financial freedom: the freedom to save.

### The Freedom to Save

Even without people marching in the streets, it is apparent to most that
these are chaotic times. Currencies are not holding their value. A
recession is looming. The most powerful men in the world are openly
fighting currency wars and are bragging about it on twitter. All while
the endless printing of money continues and politicians/bankers are
spewing propaganda to normalize negative interest rates.

People talk about Quantitative Easing (QE) and Negative Interest Rate
Policies (NIRPs) as if they were anything other than pure insanity. The
first is simply printing massive amounts of money, the second is paying
borrowers and stealing from savers.

Gone are the days where you would get interest from your money in the
bank. In the world of NIRPs, *you have to pay the bank to hold your
money*. In the same vein, gone are the days where you have to pay back
your loan plus a little extra to reimburse your lender for taking on the
risk. In the world of NIRPs, *you are getting paid to take out a loan*.
Need some money? No worries! We are giving you the money and are paying
you a little extra, for enjoying the privilege of giving you a loan!

As should be apparent for every child which is offered the choice
between two marshmallows today, or one marshmallow tomorrow: the current
financial world is defying common sense. I repeat: pure insanity.

More and more people realize that this insanity has to stop and decide
to exit a system in which a global negative-yielding debt of \$15
trillion is the new normal. The broken financial system, with its
negative interest rates and "modern" monetary policies, are, in part,
responsible for the rise of sovereign individuals all over the world.

People begin to realize the stupidity of this game. Putting pressure on
this broken system by making a run on banks is one form of peaceful
protest. Storing your value in an asset which can not be inflated, can
not be confiscated, and can not be subject to the whim of politicians
and bankers is another one.

Bitcoin is quickly becoming a safe haven asset, especially for people
who don't have easy access to more "stable" currencies than their own.
On a long enough time scale, bitcoin offers stability in a world of
global instability. It *guarantees* the right to save: nobody will be
able to take away your sats --- you must give them away willingly.

### Building towards a Sovereign Future

People are fed up with the tyranny of the banks, the tyranny of the
state, the tyranny of Facebook, WeChat, Sina Weibo, and everything else
which is "too big to fail."

It is our collective responsibility to build a better future. A future
where the freedom to transact, the freedom to remain private, and the
freedom to save your wealth over time are guaranteed. In the words of
the United Nations: [the same rights and freedoms people have offline
must also be protected online][article19].

We want to help build a world which enables sovereign individuals to
strive. A world where every individual --- and every company, for that
matter --- can use freedom-enabling technologies, as they see fit,
without asking anyone for permission. This is one of the reasons why we
have released [cyphernode], a suite of software and utilities to operate
enterprise-grade Bitcoin services, as free software.

{% include image.html name="cyphernode-bull-bitcoin.png" caption="Cyphernode - free as in freedom." %}

While it is debatable whether Bitcoin can [literally solve every problem
of the world], it is undoubtedly a big piece of the puzzle. Technologies
which empower the individual are more important than ever before.
Technologies which enable you to remain private, speak and transact
freely, or tip the balance of power towards the individual in another
way will be invaluable for the world we are heading towards.

China is giving us a taste of what living in a dystopian surveillance
state is like: you cross the street at the wrong place or the wrong
time, and thanks to facial recognition, a fine is automatically deducted
from your bank account while an algorithm adjusts your social credit
score downwards. You pay for a bus ticket to take part in a peaceful
protest, and you are at risk of being erased from the central registry,
effectively erasing your ability to live a normal life as a citizen. It
might happen today, it might happen tomorrow, or at any point in the
future. The surveillance state does not forget.

The tools to guarantee freedom for all exist today, they are just not
evenly distributed, not well understood, and not widely deployed.
However, with every passing day, more and more people are realizing what
kind of power is in their hands.

We encourage you to stay strong. We encourage you to keep on building.
We encourage you to not give in to tyranny. We, and many people like us,
will do our best to build towards a better future. Stay safe out there,
and don't forget to buy bitcoin.
