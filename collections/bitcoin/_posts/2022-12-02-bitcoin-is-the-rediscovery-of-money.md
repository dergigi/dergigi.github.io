Bitcoin is the rediscovery of money. It is [money
reconsidered](https://bitcoin-resources.com/articles/the-yieldfrom-money-held-reconsidered/).
It is the removal of counterparty risk. It is the purest, fastest, soundest
money, re-imagined from the ground up. It is [computational
proof][computation] of historical events, building up an [incorruptible
history][time] without relying on trust.

[computation]: {{ '/computation' | absolute_url }}
[time]: {{ '/time' | absolute_url }}

Bitcoin is the realization that [cryptography is not enough][cryptography]. It
is the admission that [trusted third parties are security
holes](https://bitcoin-resources.com/articles/trusted-third-parties-are-security-holes/).
It is an impenetrable fortress of validation, telling the world that [invalid
blocks need not
apply](https://bitcoin-resources.com/articles/bitcoin-miners-beware-invalid-blocks-need-not-apply/).

[cryptography]: {{ '/cryptography' | absolute_url }}

By reintroducing trust, be it via the [linguistic
attack][terminology] that
is [proof-of-stake][pos], or be it via the
regulatory attack that is centralized exchanges and custodians,
\"[crypto]\" is
destroying everything that makes Satoshi\'s invention great in the first
place.

Most people haven\'t understood yet that Bitcoin is different. It is not
a company. It can\'t go bankrupt. It has no CEO that can be influenced,
arrested, or corrupted. It is a force of nature, like the tide coming in
and out, like the sun rising in the east. You can have an opinion on it,
but your opinion won\'t influence it in any way. Every 10 minutes,
Bitcoin re-asserts itself. Every 10 minutes, it cements a message in its
timechain: \"[you shall not steal.][cryptography]\"

Bitcoin\'s monetary policy is [set in time, not by decree][digital]. It
can\'t be changed. It can\'t be argued with. It is unrelated to demand,
unrelated to energy usage, and independent from politics. 

[digital]: {{ '/digital' | absolute_url }}

The weak copies that we refer to as \"shitcoins\" are oblivious to the
nature of Bitcoin. They are oblivious to the nature of money, even;
believing that \"your money has to work for you.\" Believing that money
has to earn some sort of yield; that money itself should make a nominal
profit. 

No. Your money just has to work, period. Your money should be yours and
yours alone, and it should not steal from you. 

If your money requires permission to be spent, it is not your money. If
your money has counterparty risk, it is not money---but credit. If your
money steals from you, it is not your money---but a control and
financing mechanism of your government. If your money requires identity,
it is not money but a social credit score system. 

Money has no yield. \\
Money has no counterparty risk. \\
Money is not credit. \\
Money does not need to \"grow.\" \\
Money doesn\'t require identity. \\
Money has no memory.

\"[The whole point of money is to not know your customer][gm],\" as an Italian
comedian once said.

Bitcoin is an answer to the moral failings of fiat money and our fiat monetary
institutions.  \"[Crypto][crypto]\" is a reincarnation of these failing
institutions, replacing the friendly faces of clean-shaven bankers with the shy
smiles of unkempt teenagers.  Some call it progress. I call it unethical.

Money is as important as it is invisible. The importance of money only comes to
the forefront [when money dies](https://bitcoin-resources.com/books/when-money-dies), 
something that, arguably, is happening at a global scale as I am typing these words. 

We forgot what money is. We forgot the wisdom of old, the importance of
honest weights and measures. We forgot that usury is a sin, that love of
money for money\'s sake is the root of all evil. Consequently, we
ignored the root of all monetary evil for far too long: the government
monopoly on the issuance and control of money.

[Money production is an ethical
question](https://bitcoin-resources.com/books/the-ethics-of-money-production).
The printing of money is a moral failure, and shitcoinery is nothing but
money printing hidden behind the veil of confusion, technobabble, and
supposed innovation (or worse: altruism). 

[Bitcoin is honest](https://bitcoin-resources.com/books/honest-money), fair, and
truthful. It is [nonviolent and voluntary][peace]. It is a lifeboat and an exit,
and not to be conflated with the myriad of shitcoins that are riding its
coattails.

[peace]: {{ '/peace' | absolute_url }}

The [immaculate conception](https://21lessons.com/5/), chronological
issuance, and [organic growth][loop] of
bitcoin are what sets it apart. Its lack of counterparty risk is what
makes it money. Its lack of leadership is what makes it decentralized.
Its [computational proof of the order of events][computation] is
what makes it independently verifiable and irreversible. Its difficulty
adjustment is what makes it an autopoietic system: capable of
maintaining and [reproducing itself][life].

[loop]: {{ '/2022/04/03/inalienable-property-rights/#loop' | absolute_url }}

All shitcoins will wither into irrelevance as a consequence of
Bitcoin\'s continued existence. They will become irrelevant because the
game of money is a game of liquidity and purchasing power, and in this
game, [only the strong
survive](https://bitcoin-resources.com/articles/only-the-strong-survive/).

The world is rearranging itself. It is rearranging itself because we
have forgotten what money is. It is rearranging itself because the
current incarnation of \"money\"---government-issued debt that steals
from the poor and gives to the rich---is breaking. And while it is
breaking, bitcoin will march on. Every 10 minutes, a new block is found.
Every 10 minutes, Bitcoin reasserts itself. [Every 10 minutes][10m].

[10m]: https://bitcoin-resources.com/articles/throughthe-looking-glass-the-ft-xand-alameda-saga/

And you can be part of it. You can do the work, educate yourself, hold your own
keys, and 
[run your own node](https://bitcoin-resources.com/articles/towarda-node-world-order/).
That\'s all that bitcoin requires of you. A little bit of [responsibility]. 

If you don't hold your own keys, you don't hold bitcoin---but IOUs.
If you don't run your own node, you have no say in 
Bitcoin---you are beholden to someone else's idea of Bitcoin.

[responsibility]: {{ '/responsibility' | absolute_url }}

For bitcoin to be *your* money, you have to hold your own keys, 
and you have to *verify* with your own node.
And with that, *you* too can rediscover money. You can rediscover what
it means to have deep stability and autonomy. You can put in the work,
and you can transform yourself into a [sovereign
individual](https://bitcoin-resources.com/books/the-sovereign-individual).

You don\'t need to ask for anyone\'s permission. All you need is some
curiosity---or a lot of pain. I hope for your sake that it is curiosity
that will bring you to Bitcoin. Bitcoin can kindle curiosity---if
you\'re ready for it. Shitcoins, custodians, and the fiat monetary
system will bring the pain.

The choice is yours, and you have all the time in the world to make it.
Because [Bitcoin is, and that is
enough](https://bitcoin-resources.com/articles/bitcoinis-andthatisenough/).
It is not hiding---but waiting. Out in the open, ready to be discovered.
And with every soul that sees Bitcoin for what it is, a larger part of
humanity will rediscover what money is.
