Bitcoin works. No matter what other opinions you hold about this strange
phenomenon, it undoubtedly works, marches on, or, as I (and others) have
[previously argued][proof-of-life], is alive. Even if most of the world would
grind to a halt, the Bitcoin network would continue to produce valid blocks
every 10 minutes or so.

Bitcoin works because of many things: game theory, economic incentives,
cryptography, ingenious engineering, resilience on a network level, and
so on and so forth. Killing Bitcoin is hard. Really hard. Killing
Bitcoin is like killing an idea. An idea that is stuck in the heads of
hundreds of thousands of zealous individuals.

First of all, it is quite hard to shut down the internet globally; and
secondly, Bitcoin can transcend the internet. Everything which can
transmit data can be used to transmit bitcoin transactions, and
everything which can hold data can store a copy of Bitcoin's block
chain. It's just a ledger; the whole thing is just information.

Curiously, the Bitcoin network is embodying the eternal struggle of
life: the struggle against entropy; a battle on the edge between order
and chaos.

To understand this chaotic struggle --- and how Bitcoin thrives because
of it --- it is helpful to briefly discuss the following concepts:
entropy, randomness, and information. I hope to convince you that these
concepts are related and that they are essential in Bitcoin's ongoing
struggle for survival.

Let's dive in.

---

### Entropy

In computing, entropy can be used to measure the randomness of a data source. In
cryptography in general, and in Bitcoin in particular, a good source of entropy
is essential to keep you secure. Mess up the entropy of your private key (aka
your seed phrase) and *your* bitcoins will be *my* bitcoins soon.

*Note: the technical term for this unwanted transfer of coins is rekt. You
don't need to know what "getting rekt" means in detail, or the many ways in
which you can get rekt; it is enough to know that you should avoid such a
situation at all costs.*

Entropy is quite a complicated concept, but in general terms, it
describes how *random* or how *compressible* something is.

-   **High entropy:** randomness.
-   **Low entropy:** orderliness.

Or, in other words, with a nod to [Tsachy Weissman][tsachy-weissman]:

-   **High entropy:** not very compressible.
-   **Low entropy:** very compressible.

There are complicated formulas and quite a few disambiguous definitions of
entropy. The concept finds applications in classical thermodynamics, statistical
thermodynamics, quantum statistical physics, order and disorder, life,
astrophysics, and more. It is also a measure of irreversibility.

In Bitcoin, reversibility and irreversibility are probabilistic. If enough
people with enough hash power collude transactions could be reversed. Absolute
irreversibility does not exist in Bitcoin. Final settlement is never final, but
always probabilistic. Yes, the chances of reversal might be beyond astronomical,
but nevertheless, final settlement does not and should not exist in Bitcoin.
Nakamoto consensus forbids it.

In Bitcoin, entropy is important for multiple reasons:

1.  Secret information should be generated by high-entropy data sources
2.  New blocks reverse entropy locally, i.e. create order out of chaos
3.  Bitcoin's security model relies upon chaotic processes
4.  Validation relies on deterministic processes
5.  Everyone can validate structured data
6.  Nobody can guess random data

While the above speaks in absolutes (*everyone* and *nobody*), the truth
is more nuanced: Again, Bitcoin is *probabilistic* in nature, thus, *in
theory*, one could guess a private key just like *in theory* you could
find a billion valid blocks in one millisecond.

Details aside, we will try to keep it simple here. In general, if you
have two coins, the entropy of this system is **two**. As in: you can
describe the whole system with two bits: 00, 01, 10, 11.

{% include image.html name="entropy-flip-2-coins.png" caption="2 bits of entropy" %}

Flip both coins at the same time, and you will end up with either
tail-tail, tail-heads, heads-tail, or heads-heads. If you are a fair coin
flipper, the chance of each combination will be 25%. Imagine a system
that flips hundreds of coins at once, and you have something which could
be used to generate a private key.

---

### Randomness

Randomness is essential to cryptography. At the root of all secret
communication is some form of information asymmetry: you know something
a potential eavesdropper does not.

A good secret is like a good password: randomly generated, i.e. coming
from a data source that has a high degree of entropy.

{% include image.html name="random-noise.jpg" caption="Random noise. How much information is contained in this image?" %}

If something is "perfectly" encrypted, an eavesdropper can not
distinguish what was said from random data. This is the purpose of
proper encryption: you want to hide what was said, and, if possible,
even hide the fact that something meaningful was said at all.

-   **"Good" randomness:** not compressible / high entropy / secret /
    secure.
-   **"Bad" randomness:** compressible / low entropy / guessable /
    insecure.

Bitcoin doesn't use encryption *per se*. The ledger is public and
transparent by design, enabling anyone to audit the whole system with
the will to do so. Bitcoin uses cryptographic signatures and
cryptographic hashes, both of which produce quasi-random outcomes. And
if you know the secret, you can unlock some coins (using your private
key), add new blocks to the block chain (using the nonce you found), or
prove that you are who you say you are (by signing a message, which at
least proves that you are in control of one or multiple keys).

Only you know your private key. Nobody else should know your private
key. Only you, the successful miner, found the nonce for the next block.
That is information asymmetry. That is what makes Bitcoin work.

All cryptographic systems work because of information asymmetry. And
curiously, properly encrypted data is indistinguishable from random
data. Otherwise, an eavesdropper could make *some* sense of the
encrypted message, which in turn would mean that the encryption used
isn't very good.

### Information

What is information, anyway?

People often say that Bitcoin is thermodynamically secured. While this
is true, I'd like to dig a little deeper. What does *thermodynamically
secured* mean, exactly?

It means that --- as far as we know ---changing things in our universe
requires energy. When I say "changing things" I mean it: change anything
at all in our universe, and you will need to "use" energy --- put in
some work --- to change that thing.

Move a chair? You have to put in some work. Grow a tree? You'll need the
energy of the sun to turn CO2 into wood. Do a calculation? Energy is
required to manipulate whatever is holding the data. Store the outcome?
You'll need energy to arrange (and protect) the atoms for storage, no
matter what medium is used.

Bitcoin lives mostly in the informational realm, and just like all other
information systems, it needs to store and process the information via a
physical medium. Thus, if you change *information* in Bitcoin, you
effectively change a *thing* in the real world. Whether that thing is a
solid-state disk, USB stick, hard drive, optical storage medium, or
something else doesn't matter.

The fact that changing things --- or, in other words: [flipping
bits](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bitflip) --- requires energy, is
the root conundrum of all computation. It is the reason why your
computer makes a bunch of noise and gets hot if it does a lot of
"thinking." It is the reason that computer science students have to
study the *Big O notation* and software companies love to ask questions
about it. Changing a zero into a one requires work, and no matter how
fast you are working, you still need to expend *some* amount of energy.
According to physics, there literally is no such thing as a free lunch.
Flipping bits is work, which requires energy.

And here is the thing: Bitcoin utilizes the fact that the difference
between *hard computational problems* and *exponentially hard
computational problems* is big. Mind-bogglingly big.

Alright. Back to our original question: *What is information*, anyway?

{% include image.html name="sorted-colors.jpg" caption="Sorted colors. How much information is contained in this image?" %}

Information relates to both *knowledge* and *meaning*. It is the
opposite of not knowing, and the opposite of information in data is
randomness. In other words: if you are not able to make sense of some
data, it might appear random *to you*.

-   **Sensible information:** quite compressible.
-   **Nonsense information:** not very compressible.

Pi might help to clear up what I'm trying to say: 3.141592653589793...
can be "compressed" into Ï€, or the circumference of a circle with the
diameter of one.

As a computer programmer, you could think of this concept as follows:
can I write a computer program that generates the information I'm trying
to convey, which is actually shorter than the information itself?
(That's what I mean when I say "compressible".)

In short: sense and nonsense, order and chaos, or *information* and
*randomness* are intricately linked. One could say that they are two
sides of the same coin, and both concepts are related via something we
call *entropy*.

Information implies structure and structure benefits from redundancy.
The most ancient structures in nature have been adapted for survival by
evolution. At the root of it is DNA, two chains that coil around each
other to form a double helix. Symmetric, redundant information. The
properties which allow DNA to survive and thrive are embedded in its
processes: redundant structure, a copying mechanism that relies on this
structure, the baked-in error correction which leads to four bases
instead of two, etc.

Bitcoin, in comparison, is simpler: one chain, two bits, no error
correction (information is copied perfectly). However, as with DNA, the
properties which allow Bitcoin to survive (and thrive) are embedded in
the replication process: a chaotic race to find new blocks, replication
of blocks in the network, and replication of the software (and the
ledger) on as many nodes as possible. Further, when we talk about the
Bitcoin organism, error correction is equivalent to being alive. The
network self-validates with every beat of the heart, every ten minutes
or so. This is what makes the bitcoin organism extremely robust as well.
It is *designed* for survival.

In Bitcoin, high entropy information is usually kept secret. Your
*private key* should, as the name implies, be kept private. It is for
your eyes only. Which particular *nonce* you just tried, i.e. the work
you already did when mining a new block, is usually kept private as
well. You don't want your competitors to know which numbers produce
invalid blocks and can be skipped.

{% include image.html name="chaos-order-bar.png" caption="Chaos on the left, Order on the right." %}

Bitcoin utilizes both *order* and *chaos* to create a system that grows
--- and even thrives --- between these extremes. It utilizes information
asymmetry and an ingenious incentive structure which leads to a global
competition to find Bitcoin's secrets.

Which processes are orderly, which are chaotic, and how Bitcoin is able
to grow on the edge between order and chaos will be explored in the next
section.

### Growth between Order and Chaos

What makes the Bitcoin network tick? Again, there might be many answers
to this question, but the only thing that is *truly* ticking in the
Bitcoin network is the global clock: a *block clock*, where every block
is one unit of time.

Currently, we call this process *mining* because new bitcoins are
generated for every valid block that is *mined* (read: *found*). We call
this the block subsidy, and it is an incentive structure to bootstrap
the network.

In a sense, the Bitcoin organism "grows" on the edge between order and
chaos: finding new blocks is a chaotic process, and its result is a very
orderly list of transactions: the Bitcoin *block chain*, also known as
*the ledger*.

From a "finding new blocks" point of view, we are still extremely early.
Only \~10 years in. The block reward era will go on until the year 2140
or so, which means we are about 13% into the bootstrapping phase of
Bitcoin: the reward era.

Satoshi undoubtedly knew that this was a long game. The era where fresh
blocks are associated with a reward is only one phase of the Bitcoin
game. Note that this phase is 6930000 blocks long. With an average block
time of \~10 minutes, the reward era turns out to be 131 years long.

{% include image.html name="reward-era-timeline.png" caption="2019: Early days of the Bitcoin Reward Era" %}

There will be a time where those who are tasked with finding new blocks
are rewarded mostly via the networks' fee market, as Dan Held
brilliantly argued in [Bitcoin's Security is
Fine](https://blog.picks.co/bitcoins-security-is-fine-93391d9b61a8). The
point in time where the fee market takes over will be somewhere between
the year 2020 and 2140. Either that, or Bitcoin will die, or some museum
computers will try to find new blocks at an economic loss.

After this point in time, we will probably still talk about "mining"
bitcoin, even though all the "miners" won't be producing any *new*
bitcoins. All 21 million BTC --- or 2,099,999,997,690,000 sats, to be
precise --- will have been mined. No new bitcoin will be added to the
pool of existing coins in circulation.

Miners --- if we still call them that ---will still try to find new
blocks, mind you. But the bitcoin moved by these blocks will have a long
economic history. Gone are the days where miners award themselves new
bitcoin in the *coinbase* transaction, to be spent after 100 blocks.

Will bitcoin still exist in 5000 years, and eventually beat gold as the
de-facto money of humanity? I don't know, but important information is
extremely hard to kill. I expect bitcoin to live for a very long time,
just like ancient scriptures and religious texts survive to this day. It
is just information, all of it, and it can transcend the medium it is
printed on.

Of course, I expect something approximating
[hyperbitcoinization](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/)
to have happened until this point. We will have a circular bitcoin
economy, and bitcoin banks will globally settle vast amounts of value
between them. What private citizens --- or sovereign individuals, to use
a more fitting term --- will use is yet to be seen. I doubt that the
bitcoin base layer will be used by persons like you and me. And that's
perfectly fine.

With the stage set, and concepts like order, information, randomness,
and entropy in mind, let's take a look at some bitcoin concepts. We will
distinguish them visually: from chaotic (left) to orderly (right).

{% include image.html name="chaos-order-chaintip.png" caption="Bitcoin grows between order and chaos." %}

While the framing of order and chaos is useful, it is neither precise
nor universally applicable. However, I believe that thinking about the
parts which make Bitcoin tick in this way is a helpful exercise, and I
believe that the core point --- that bitcoin lives, grows, and thrives
on the edge between order and chaos --- is profoundly true.

{% include image.html name="chaos-order-concepts.png" %}

Let's ponder on these concepts for a bit.

-   **Private key:** Chaotic information, very high randomness. Secret
    information which is best kept private. Maximum entropy for maximum
    security. If your private key is not random, you're gonna have a bad time.
-   **Nonce:** Chaotic information, high randomness. A nonce is a specific
    number. Miners are in constant competition to find the next nonce which
    produces a valid block. Multiple numbers might fit the criteria, but the
    mining process is very much like finding one random number.
-   **Fresh block (before broadcast):** Newly found blocks are the outcome of
    the chaotic process which is finding a nonce. Before blocks are broadcast,
    blocks can be understood as secret information. Fresh blocks can be
    ambiguous, since multiple blocks can form a valid chain tip at the same
    time. It is in your best interest to broadcast a fresh block immediately to
    everyone to reap the reward. Fresh blocks are only held back if you are an
    attacker, or very stupid, or both.
-   **Chain tip:** Forming the chain tip is a process which is mostly orderly,
    but again, it is generated by a chaotic process. As mentioned above, the
    chain tip can be ambiguous. One version of the chain tip will survive, the
    losing versions will become orphan blocks. You can validate the correctness
    of all information in all blocks up to the chain tip. The chain tip reflects
    the current time in Bitcoin.
-   **Orphan blocks:** Orphan blocks are part of the orderly, natural growth
    process of the Bitcoin block chain. Valid blocks are discarded on a regular
    basis. If two valid blocks are found at roughly the same time, they fight a
    probabilistic battle for survival. In the long run, only one block can win
    this race. The losing block will become an orphan block and die a lonely
    death.
-   **Unconfirmed transactions**: Orderly structure which can be easily
    validated. An unconfirmed transaction can be valid or invalid. Valid
    transactions are included in blocks based on economic incentives, which is
    --- again --- a probabilistic, market-driven process. Invalid transactions
    are discarded.
-   **Buried blocks:** Orderly structure generated by a chaotic process, some
    time ago. The possibility of a *reorg* (re-organization of buried blocks)
    becomes exponentially unlikely because the probabilities against it
    multiply. Example: if every block has a 50% chance to reorg, the chance of a
    6 block reorg would be 1.5%. Actual numbers are closer to 0.31% per block
    and 0.0000000000008875% for a 6 block reorg.
-   **Confirmed transactions:** Orderly structure which can be validated very
    easily. Irreversibility is probabilistic and dependent on block height. Once
    a transaction is confirmed, it becomes more final the deeper it is buried in
    the block chain.
-   **Public keys:** extended public keys (xpub, ypub, zpub) are generated by a
-   deterministic process from a random seed --- your private key.
-   **Block time:** Valid blocks are found, on average, every 10 minutes. This
    is what makes the Bitcoin network tick. Bitcoin's heartbeat is extremely
    regular when measured in blocks. While still regular when measured in human
    time, mining is a fundamentally probabilistic process, and thus there is a
    real possibility that some blocks are found very quickly or comparably late.
-   **Difficulty adjustment:** While the difficulty adjustment is a very orderly
    process, it can be a bit chaotic if hash power changes drastically (as it
    did in August 2017, because of the contentious bcash hard fork). Difficulty
    adjustment is based on block time, which is only probabilistically linked to
    human time.
-   **Bitcoin supply:** Bitcoin's supply is fixed since its inception. The
    issuance of new bitcoin is embedded in Bitcoin's consensus code and is thus
    virtually impossible to change.
-   **Whole ledger, deeply buried blocks (aka the Bitcoin block chain):**
    Orderly, sequential, structure which is pretty much unambiguous up to the
    chain tip and can be validated by everyone.
-   **Ledger validation:** Validation is an orderly, sequential process. The
    outcome of this process is a simple boolean value for each block: true or
    false, valid or invalid. Every node arrives at the same block height
    independently, which is what forms Nakamoto consensus.

The fact that all of the above, the whole machinery, works in concert to
provide a *yes* or *no* answer to the question *"Is this what actually
happened?"* will never cease to amaze me.

Let me repeat the above. The whole purpose of the Bitcoin organism is to
decide *what* happened *when* to *whom*. How much does everyone have,
and how did this come to be? The *how* is important, because it allows
everyone to audit everything, and come to the same conclusion.

In short, Bitcoin utilizes chaotic processes (mining, private key
generation) and information asymmetry (public information which is
widely shared, secret information which is not shared at all) to build
up a structured, orderly, and permanent record, that can be audited and
verified by everyone.

This is Bitcoin. This is Nakamoto consensus. This is the innovation, and
this is also what makes bitcoin the best and hardest money that ever
existed on planet earth.

You might call it open, permissionless, borderless, neutral,
censorship-resistant, public, sound, antifragile, and a couple of other
adjectives.

**I call it Life. And we all call it Bitcoin.**
