The definition of life has been a challenge for scientists and
philosophers alike. While many definitions have been put forward, what
precisely differentiates the living from the non-living remains elusive.
Are viruses alive? DNA molecules? Computer viruses? Biologically
produced minerals?

Ralph Merkle, inventor of cryptographic hashing and namesake of the
Merkle tree, made the argument that Bitcoin is the first example of a
new form of life. In this article series, I intend to take this claim
seriously, explore it further, and see what can be gleaned from viewing
Bitcoin as a living organism.

The first part will establish that Bitcoin is indeed a living organism.
The second part will take a closer look at Bitcoin's various habitats,
and how changes in these habitats might affect the organism. In the
third part we will dissect the Bitcoin organism, trying to understand
some of its parts in more detail. Finally, we will perform the thought
experiment of trying to kill Bitcoin, to illustrate the remarkable
resilience of this strange, decentralized organism.

### What is Life?

The question of whether something is alive or not obviously hinges on
one's definition of life. Life is endlessly complex, so it is no
surprise that answering the question "What is Life?" leads to a
multitude of answers. New-age speculations aside, it seems that life is
a process, not a substance.

We can try to describe this process by looking at things which are
alive, and looking at what they do: they tend to grow, reproduce, and
respond. They inherit traits, are made up of smaller units (cells), and
use energy to maintain their internal structure in the face of entropy.

From a physics perspective, living things are thermodynamic systems:
they utilize the energy-differences in their surroundings to maintain a
specific molecular organization and create copies of themselves.
Thermodynamically speaking, living systems are able to decrease their
internal entropy at the expense of "free" energy taken in from the
environment. In short, living things create order out of chaos.

Bitcoin is doing exactly that: it takes energy from the environment and
puts things in order, i.e. it decreases its internal entropy. It does so
by appending blocks to a well-ordered structure. Some call this
structure the blockchain, others call it a distributed ledger. I will
refrain from using either name, since the name of this particular
structure isn't important, and doesn't help to convey a deeper truth:
that this structure is just one part of a large and complex system, just
like the backbone in vertebrates. It is important, no doubt. But
distributed or not, a ledger on its own is as useful and as alive as a
bag of bones.

To understand why Bitcoin behaves animatedly we will have to look beyond
the buzzwords and ask ourselves what Bitcoin actually is, what it is
made of, and what its boundaries are.

### What is Bitcoin?

Compared to biological life, Bitcoin is quite simple. Nevertheless,
finding a succinct answer to "What is Bitcoin?" is not.

Depending on your background it might be a computer network, a financial
revolution, a way to protect your wealth, a payment system, a global
settlement layer, an alternative to central banking, sound money, a
parallel economy, an exercise in free speech, a bubble, a pyramid
scheme, a messaging system, a communications protocol, an inefficient
database, internet money, or all of the above. In short, Bitcoin is
different things to different people.

Whatever Bitcoin might be, it undoubtedly is a force to be reckoned
with. It has a life of its own, and thus arguably, it is best described
as a living thing.

Many people seem to have come to this conclusion independently. Bitcoin
is described as an army of leaf-cutter ants in [Andreas M.
Antonopoulos]' Mastering Bitcoin --- a biological system which is
working in concert without a central coordinator. The honey badger, an
animal which is commonly used to refer to Bitcoin (since it doesn't care
and isn't afraid of anything) is on the cover of [Jimmy Song]'s
Programming Bitcoin. [Dan Held] compared the invention of Bitcoin to
planting a tree, examining the species (code), season (timing), soil
(distribution), and gardening (community) that were essential to its
success. [Brandon Quittem] postulates that Bitcoin is most similar to
mycelium, the underground network which powers the fungi kingdom, and
can thus be best understood as a decentralized organism.

{% include image.html name="organism-books.png" %}

The snake of regulation and central banking is biting you while you are
eating it alive? *Honey badger don't care!* And just like an army of
ants doesn't care if half of the workers are washed away by a flood, the
Bitcoin network doesn't care if half of the nodes are offline tomorrow.

> "Honey badger don't care, honey badger don't give a fuck."
> <cite>[Randall][randall]</cite>

Memes like these, especially if they survive and continue to be popular
over a long period of time, tend to be right, conceptually. What people
seem to be saying when they refer to Bitcoin as the honey badger is
that, in essence, Bitcoin behaves like an animal which can't be
controlled, can't be tamed, and doesn't care too much about
externalities.

Which particular organism Bitcoin resembles most closely will be left as
an exercise for the reader. The above examples should merely illustrate
that multiple authors made the intellectual leap of classifying Bitcoin
as a living organism - a leap which I believe to be fascinating, useful,
and ultimately, correct.

Bitcoin is a living organism, and we should try to understand it as such
if we want to live in harmony with it.

### The Bitcoin Organism

As mentioned above, Ralph Merkle was the first to point out that Bitcoin
can be seen as a living entity. He remarked that Bitcoin has spawned an
incredible amount of excitement in the technical community, and tried to
translate this excitement into something which can be understood by
everybody: a new form of life.

> "Briefly, and non-technically, Bitcoin is the first example of a new
> form of life. It lives and breathes on the internet. It lives because

> useful service that people will pay it to perform. It lives because

> if any one copy is corrupted it is discarded, quickly and without any
> fuss or muss. It lives because it is radically transparent: anyone can
> see its code and see exactly what it does."
> <cite>[Ralph Merkle][merkle]</cite>

While Bitcoin is indeed radically transparent, it is not perfectly
obvious where Bitcoin begins and where it ends. Like all living things,
Bitcoin isn't just a uniform blob of matter. It is a dynamic, *living*
thing, consisting of many different parts, all of which communicate with
and influence each other, as well as other living things and the
environment as a whole.

The Bitcoin organism is made up of many interlocking parts which work
together to ensure the survival of the whole. As with biological
organisms, as soon as one crucial part is missing, the whole organism is
bound to die.

Bitcoin, however, is a strange beast. It lives across domains, with one
foot in the purely informational realm (ideas and code) and one foot in
the physical realm (people and nodes).

{% include image.html name="cyberspace-meatspace.png" %}

The Bitcoin organism manifests itself through the interplay of ideas,
code, people, and nodes. All four of these conceptual pieces react to
and influence each other in a value-generating [feedback loop][gravity] which
keeps Bitcoin alive.

Whether people are part of the Bitcoin organism, or merely living in
symbiosis with it, depends on your point of view. For now, let's take an
all-encompassing view of the Bitcoin organism, including people as one
part of the whole. After all, just like we can't live without a
multitude of bacteria, fungi, viruses and other creepy-crawlies which
make up the human microbiome, Bitcoin can't live without us: the tiny
beings in meatspace which keep it alive.

In any case, nodes and their operators are tangible things which are
manifest in the physical world. Like the cells in your body, all
physical components of the Bitcoin organism can and will be replaced
over time. Node operators come and go, node and mining hardware is
replaced periodically, and even whole mining farms go offline and are
replaced by more cost-efficient facilities.

Ideas and code are more ethereal. They can't be grasped or pointed to in
the same fashion. However, Bitcoin has an *essence*, the *soul* of the
organism, if you like. Note that this essence could, in theory, breathe
life into a new host if the current incarnation of the organism dies.
The ghost of Bitcoin is independent of its physical body, to borrow a
metaphor from Shirow's *Ghost in the Shell.*

As long as something is compatible with this essence, it will be treated
as part of the whole. If something is incompatible, however, it will be
rejected --- just like biological organisms reject foreign objects
inside their bodies.

Part of this essence is made explicit by Bitcoin's consensus rules,
other parts are repeated as mantras: *"not your keys, not your bitcoin"*
and *"run your own node"* are gentle reminders of lessons learned, as
well as shortcuts to a deeper understanding of what Bitcoin is and
should be.

With a basic idea of the constituents and the extent of the Bitcoin
organism in mind, let's return to the descriptive definition of life
above and see how Bitcoin maps onto each trait.

{% include image.html name="alive-bitcoin.png" %}

-   **Growth:** Bitcoin grows in multiple ways. The network grows, the
    value of each bitcoin grows, the market grows, its user base grows,
    and the ecosystem as a whole grows as well.
-   **Reproduction:** Paradoxically, Bitcoin uses replication to create
    [absolute scarcity]. It reproduces itself in multiple ways, and on
    multiple levels: the source code is replicated across repositories,
    the software is copying itself upon installation, the ledger
    reproduces itself on every node, blocks propagate across the network
    by replication, and even UTXOs can be understood as reproductive
    entities, dividing and merging during the transaction process.
    Mutations exist on every level as well: invalid transactions,
    invalid blocks, hundreds of forks, and thousands of imperfect copies
    have been spawned by Bitcoin in the last couple of years.
-   **Heredity:** Bitcoin inherits several traits from its
    predecessors: public-key cryptography, digital signatures,
    peer-to-peer networking, digital timestamping, and unforgeable
    costliness --- just to name a few. Further, Bitcoin's open nature
    enables both vertical and horizontal gene transfer: some traits
    develop by gradual mutations of previous versions, others find their
    way into the codebase by incorporating ideas from other
    projects.
-   **Homeostasis:** Above all else, Bitcoin's consensus rules are
    responsible for its stable inner conditions. If blocks do not adhere
    to the current consensus rules, they will be rejected mercilessly
    and quickly. The Bitcoin network will rid itself of these blocks
    just like we shed the dead cells of our skin.
-   **Metabolism:** Mining rigs around the world keep the organism
    alive, erecting virtually [impenetrable walls][energy] in the process.
    Energy is transformed into digital amber, ensuring that the shield
    around past transactions is growing and Bitcoin's heart keeps
    beating.
-   **Cellular:** Multiple parts of Bitcoin are cellular: the Bitcoin
    network consists of nodes, each of which a self-sustaining,
    functional entity. The ledger itself is cellular since blocks (and
    transactions) are basically cells in a large, append-only
    spreadsheet.
-   **Responsive:** Bitcoin is a highly responsive organism. It
    responds to changes in price, political changes, economic changes,
    environmental changes (e.g. if parts of the internet are cut off),
    technological changes (e.g. breakthroughs in chip manufacturing),
    and changes in our scientific understanding (e.g. breakthroughs in
    computer science, mathematics, or cryptography). It reacts on its
    own, without any person, company, or nation-state in charge.

As mentioned above, life is a process, not a substance. A delicate dance
of innumerable parts, all signaling and communicating in an intricate
way to self-sustain each organism, and the phenomenon which we call life
as a whole.

> <cite>[Christopher McKay][mckay]</cite>

In the words of astrobiologist Chris McKay, the simplest proof of life
is to find something that is alive. I have found Bitcoin, and as far as
I can tell, it is alive --- for all the reasons outlined above.

----

Bitcoin checks all the boxes when it comes to the characteristics of
living things: it grows, reproduces, inherits and passes on traits, uses
energy to maintain a stable inner structure, is cellular in nature, and
responds to the various environments it lives in.

In the next part of this series we will take a closer look at these
environments, and how Bitcoin responds to changes in them. Bitcoin lives
and breathes on the internet, as Ralph Merkle beautifully said. But
arguably, the internet isn't the only environment it is living in.

For now, I hope to have convinced you that Bitcoin can be seen as a
living organism --- alien as it may be.
