Some questions have easy answers. "What have you learned from Bitcoin?"
isn't one of them. After trying to answer this question in a short
tweet, and failing miserably, I realized that the amount of things I've
learned is far too numerous to answer quickly, if at all. I also
realized that any set of answers to this question will be different for
everyone --- a reflection of the very personal journey through the
wonderful world of crypto. Hence, the subtitle of this series is *What
I've Learned From Bitcoin*, with which I want to acknowledge the
inherent personal bias of answering a question like this.

I tried to group the teachings of Bitcoin by topics, resulting in three
parts:

1. **[Philosophical Teachings of Bitcoin][I]**
2. [Economic Teachings of Bitcoin][II]
3. [Technological Teachings of Bitcoin][III]

As hinted above, attempting to answer this question fully is a fool's
errand, thus my answers will always be incomplete. I would like to
lessen this shortcoming by inviting you, dear reader, to share your own
answers to [this question]:

{% include image.html name="tweet.png" %}

Bitcoin is indeed a game disguised. It is akin to a trapdoor, a gateway
to a different world. A world much stranger than I would have ever
imagined it to be. A world which takes your assumptions and shatters
them into a thousand tiny pieces, again and again. Stick around for long
enough, and Bitcoin will completely change your worldview.

### Lesson 1: Immutability and change

Bitcoin is inherently hard to describe. It is a *new* *thing*, and any
attempt to draw a comparison to previous concepts --- be it by calling
it digital gold or the internet of money --- is bound to fall short of
the whole. Whatever your favorite analogy might be, two aspects of
Bitcoin are absolutely essential: decentralization and immutability.

One way to think about Bitcoin is as an [automated social contract]. The
software is just one piece of the puzzle, and hoping to change Bitcoin
by changing the software is an exercise in futility. One would have to
convince the rest of the network to adopt the changes, which is more a
psychological effort than a software engineering one.

The following might sound absurd at first, like so many other things in
this space, but I believe that it is profoundly true nonetheless: You
won't change Bitcoin, but Bitcoin will change you.

> "Bitcoin will change us more than we will change it."
> <cite>[Marty Bent]</cite>

It took me a long time to realize the profundity of this. Since Bitcoin
is just software and all of it is open-source, you can simply change
things at will, right? Wrong. *Very* wrong. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin's
creator knew this all too well.

> The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the
> core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.
> <cite>[Satoshi Nakamoto]</cite>

Many people have attempted to change Bitcoin's nature. So far all of
them have failed. While there is an endless sea of forks and altcoins,
the Bitcoin network still does its thing, just as it did when the first
node went online. The altcoins won't matter in the long run. The forks
will eventually starve to death. Bitcoin is what matters. As long as our
fundamental understanding of mathematics and/or physics doesn't change,
the Bitcoin honeybadger will continue to not care.

> "Bitcoin is the first example of a new form of life. It lives and
> breathes on the internet. It lives because it can pay people to keep
> it alive. [...] It can't be changed. It can't be argued with. It
> can't be tampered with. It can't be corrupted. It can't be stopped.
> [...] If nuclear war destroyed half of our planet, it would continue
> to live, uncorrupted. "
> <cite>[Ralph Merkle]</cite>

The heartbeat of the Bitcoin network will outlast all of ours.

Realizing the above changed me way more than the past blocks of the
Bitcoin blockchain ever will. It changed my time preference, my
understanding of economics, my political views, and so much more. Hell,
it is even [changing people's diets]. If all of this sounds crazy to
you, you're in good company. All of this is crazy, and yet it is
happening.

Bitcoin taught me that it won't change. I will.

### Lesson 2: The scarcity of scarcity

In general, the advance of technology seems to make things more
abundant. More and more people are able to enjoy what previously have
been luxurious goods. Soon, we will all live like kings. Most of us
already do. As Peter Diamandis wrote in [Abundance][]: "Technology is a
resource-liberating mechanism. It can make the once scarce the now
abundant."

Bitcoin, an advanced technology in itself, breaks this trend and creates
a new commodity which is truly scarce. Some even argue that it is one of
the scarcest things in the universe. The supply can't be inflated, no
matter how much effort one chooses to expend towards creating more.

> "Only two things are genuinely scarce: time and bitcoin."
> <cite>[Saifedean Ammous]</cite>

Paradoxically, it does so by a mechanism of copying. Transactions are
broadcast, blocks are propagated, the distributed ledger is --- well,
you guessed it --- distributed. All of these are just fancy words for
copying. Heck, Bitcoin even copies itself onto as many computers as it
can, by incentivizing individual people to run full nodes and mine new
blocks.

All of this duplication wonderfully works together in a concerted effort
to produce scarcity.

In a time of abundance, Bitcoin taught me what real scarcity is.

### Lesson 3: An immaculate conception

Everyone loves a good origin story. The origin story of Bitcoin is a
fascinating one, and the details of it are more important than one might
think at first. Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? Was he one person or a group of
people? Was he a she? Time-traveling alien, or advanced AI? Outlandish
theories aside, we will probably never know. And this is important.

Satoshi chose to be anonymous. He planted the seed of Bitcoin. He stuck
around for long enough to make sure the network won't die in its
infancy. And then he vanished.

What might look like a weird anonymity stunt is actually crucial for a
truly decentralized system. No centralized control. No centralized
authority. No inventor. No-one to prosecute, torture, blackmail, or
extort. An immaculate conception of technology.

> "One of the greatest things that Satoshi did was disappear."
> <cite>[Jimmy Song]</cite>

Since the birth of Bitcoin, thousands of other cryptocurrencies were
created. None of these clones share its origin story. If you want to
supersede Bitcoin, you will have to transcend its origin story. In a war
of ideas, narratives dictate survival.

> "Gold was first fashioned into jewelry and used for barter over 7,000
> years ago. Gold's captivating gleam led to it being considered a gift
> from the gods."
> <cite>[Gold: The Extraordinary Metal]</cite>

Like gold in ancient times, Bitcoin might be considered a gift from the
gods. Unlike gold, Bitcoins origins are all too human. And this time, we
know who the gods of development and maintenance are: people all over
the world, anonymous or not.

Bitcoin taught me that narratives are important.

### Lesson 4: The problem of identity

Nic Carter, in an homage to Thomas Nagel's treatment of the same
question [in regards to a bat], wrote an excellent piece which discusses
the following question: [What is it like to be a bitcoin?] He
brilliantly shows that open, public blockchains in general, and Bitcoin
in particular, suffer from the same conundrum as the [Ship of
Theseus][]: which Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin?

> "Consider just how little persistence Bitcoin's components have. The
> entire codebase has been reworked, altered, and expanded such that it
> barely resembles its original version. [...] The registry of who
> owns what, the ledger itself, is virtually the only persistent trait
> of the network [...]
>
> To be considered truly leaderless, you must surrender the easy
> solution of having an entity that can designate one chain as the
> legitimate one."
> <cite>[Nic Carter][What is it like to be a bitcoin?]</cite>

It seems like the advancement of technology keeps forcing us to take
these philosophical questions seriously. Sooner or later, self-driving
cars will be faced with real-world versions of the [trolley problem],
forcing them to make ethical decisions about whose lives do matter and
whose do not.

Cryptocurrencies, especially since the first contentious hard-fork,
force us to think about and agree upon the metaphysics of identity.
Interestingly, the two biggest examples we have so far have lead to two
different answers. On August 1, 2017, Bitcoin split into two camps. The
market decided that the unaltered chain is the original Bitcoin. One
year earlier, on October 25, 2016, Ethereum split into two camps. The
market decided that the *altered* chain is the original Ethereum.

If properly decentralized, the questions posed by the *Ship of Theseus*
will have to be answered in perpetuity for as long as these networks of
value-transfer exist.

Bitcoin taught me that decentralization contradicts identity.

### Lesson 5: Replication and locality

Quantum mechanics aside, locality is a non-issue in the physical world.
The question *"Where is X?"* can be answered in a meaningful way, no
matter if X is a person or an object. In the digital world, the question
of *where* is already a tricky one, but not impossible to answer. Where
are your emails, really? A bad answer would be "the cloud", which is
just someone else's computer. Still, if you wanted to track down every
storage device which has your emails on it you could, in theory, locate
them.

With bitcoin, the question of "where" is *really* tricky. Where,
exactly, are your bitcoins?

> "I opened my eyes, looked around, and asked the inevitable, the
> traditional, the lamentably hackneyed postoperative question: 'Where
> am l?'"
> <cite>[Daniel Dennett]</cite>

The problem is twofold: First, the distributed ledger is distributed by
full replication, meaning the ledger is everywhere. Second, there are no
bitcoins. Not only physically, but *technically*.

Bitcoin keeps track of a set of unspent transaction outputs, without
ever having to refer to an entity which represents a bitcoin. The
existence of a bitcoin is inferred by looking at the set of unspent
transaction outputs and calling every entry with a 100 million base
units a bitcoin.

> "Where is it, at this moment, in transit? [...] First, there are no
> bitcoins. There just aren't. They don't exist. There are ledger
> entries in a ledger that's shared [...] They don't exist in any
> physical location. The ledger exists in every physical location,
> essentially. Geography doesn't make sense here --- it is not going to
> help you figuring out your policy here."
> <cite>[Peter Van Valkenburgh]</cite>

So, what do you actually own when you say *"I have a bitcoin"* if there
are no bitcoins? Well, remember all these strange words which you were
forced to write down by the wallet you used? Turns out these magic words
are what you own: [a magic spell] which can be used to add some entries
to the public ledger --- the keys to "move" some bitcoins. This is why,
for all intents and purposes, your private keys *are* your bitcoins. If
you think I'm making all of this up feel free to send me your private
keys.

Bitcoin taught me that locality is a tricky business.

### Lesson 6: The power of free speech

Bitcoin is an idea. An idea which, in its current form, is the
manifestation of a machinery purely powered by text. Every aspect of
Bitcoin is text: The whitepaper is text. The software which is run by
its nodes is text. The ledger is text. Transactions are text. Public and
private keys are text. Every aspect of Bitcoin is text, and thus
equivalent to speech.

> "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
> or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
> speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
> assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
> <cite>[First Amendment to the United States Constitution][1st Amendment]</cite>

Although the final battle of the [Crypto Wars] has not been fought yet,
it will be very difficult to criminalize an idea, let alone an idea
which is based on the exchange of text messages. Every time a government
tries to outlaw text or speech, we slip down a path of absurdity which
inevitably leads to abominations like [illegal numbers] and [illegal
primes].

As long as there is a part of the world where speech is free as in
*freedom*, Bitcoin is unstoppable.

> "There is no point in any Bitcoin transaction that Bitcoin ceases to
> be *text.* It is *all* *text*, all the time. [...]
>
> Bitcoin is **text.** Bitcoin is **speech.** It cannot be regulated in
> a free country like the USA with guaranteed inalienable rights and a
> First Amendment that explicitly excludes the act of publishing from
> government oversight."
> <cite>[Beautyon]</cite>

Bitcoin taught me that in a free society, free speech and free software
are unstoppable.

### Lesson 7: The limits of knowledge

Getting into Bitcoin is a humbling experience. I thought that I knew
things. I thought that I was educated. I thought that I knew my computer
science, at the very least. I studied it for years, so I have to know
everything about digital signatures, hashes, encryption, operational
security, and networks, right?

Wrong.

Learning all the fundamentals which make Bitcoin work is hard.
Understanding all of them deeply is borderline impossible.

> "No one has found the bottom of the Bitcoin rabbit hole."
> <cite>[Jameson Lopp]</cite>

My list of books to read keeps expanding way quicker than I could
possibly read them. The list of papers and articles to read is virtually
endless. There are more podcasts on all of these topics than I could
ever listen to. It truly is humbling. Further, Bitcoin is evolving and
it's almost impossible to stay up-to-date with the accelerating rate of
innovation. The dust of the first layer hasn't even settled yet, and
people have already built the second layer and are working on the third.

Bitcoin taught me that I know very little about almost anything. It
taught me that this rabbit hole is bottomless.

### Conclusion

Bitcoin is a child of the internet. Even though it requires computers to
function efficiently, computer science is not sufficient to understand
it. The implications of this new technology are far-reaching. Bitcoin is
not only borderless but also boundaryless in respect to academic
disciplines.

In this first part of the *Teachings of Bitcoin* I tried to outline some
of the philosophical implications of this fascinating machinery. In part
two I will try to discuss what Bitcoin taught me about economics. Part
three will conclude this series to show what I, a technologist, have
learned from the tech perspective by stumbling into Bitcoin.

As mentioned above, I think that any answer to the question *"What have
you learned from Bitcoin?"* will always be incomplete. The systems are
too dynamic, the space moving too fast, and the topics too numerous.
Politics, game theory, monetary history, network theory, finance,
cryptography, information theory, censorship, law and regulation, human
organization, psychology --- all these and more are areas of expertise
which might help to grasp what Bitcoin is.

What have you learned from Bitcoin?
