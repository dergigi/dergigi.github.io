It may be that earthward-looking windows do not allow you to see the shining city beyond, but some of these windows are awe-inspiring nevertheless. We were fortunate enough to look earthward in the last couple of weeks, both from high above and from deep underground.

My view of the world keeps changing as I grow older. It changed more in the last three years than I ever thought it would. Albert Schweitzer once said that "world-view is a product of life-view, not vice versa." So maybe my view of life is what changed.

Artists have indeed changed my world view. So have scientists, engineers, philosophers, economists, and many other people who might have less "prestigious" professions. Prestigious professions and shiny titles don't matter anyway. What matters, in the end, depends on your point of view.

A shift in perspective is a dangerous thing: you might start to see things differently, and before you know it, your whole world view has changed.
