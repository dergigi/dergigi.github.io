One part of the journey seems to be over. However, as is the case in all of
life, there is no clear separation between parts. So I won't try to create one.
One journey comes to an end, but still, the journey continues. Where this
journey will lead is anyone's guess, but I feel both confident and optimistic.
Even without a known destination, things are going in the right direction.

The last couple of weeks have been quite eventful. Meeting old friends, and
saying farewell to new ones. Leaving one paradise to enter a different one.
Encounters with tragedy, and encounters with hope. I am grateful for all of it.

Some ships have sailed. That's how things are, and how things should be. You
can't board multiple ships at the same time, just like you can't walk many paths
at once. Every step taken is another step not taken, in a million different
directions.

Again, where this ship will take us is anyone's guess. But we are setting sail,
enjoying the breeze, and learning how to fish. And it feels great.
