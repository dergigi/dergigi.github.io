Joy. Delight. Bliss. Glee To enjoy oneself, or what one does, or what one
experiences. Not too long ago, I thought that these moments of pure,
unadulterated joy were nothing but short bursts in-between dull and gray
drudgery; small gifts which make life bearable. Oh, what a horrible thing to
think.

I now realize that the theft of joy in my life was systemic, and I have the
suspicion that I was not the sole victim of this crime.

Joy: finding meaning in a meaningless universe, hope in a hopeless world,
delight in breathing, profundity in what seems ordinary. The world is truly
magical if one dares to look at it properly.

For the first time since a long while, I can truly say that I enjoy what I am
doing. And what I'm doing is strange indeed. I talk with strangers for hours on
end; strangers which I've never seen and never met. I write about things which I
do not understand; things which are too complicated to be understood fully. I
build things without having an exact blueprint; some might be useful, others
won't be. It doesn't matter, I enjoy it anyway.

Martin Luther King Jr. was right. It cannot be completely explained by those
symbols called words. So I won't even try. But I guess I will keep doing what
I'm doing. Walking the path ahead, guided by joy.
