Callings are a very strange thing, and I sometimes find myself in a pickle
trying to explain phenomena like these rationally. There are certain things
you _have_ to do, but you can't really explain it. You just know
this is something you need to be doing right now. Sometimes it's things you
always wanted to do, but never had the courage; sometimes it's things you
don't want to do at all. Peculiar things, those callings.

A calling for another shore, where we can laugh our lives away and be free
once more. Sounds like a call I should answer.
