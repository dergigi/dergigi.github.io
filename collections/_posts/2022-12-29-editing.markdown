Editing is divine, or so the saying goes.

A wise man once said that "the secret to life is send tweet." There is no place
for editing in this philosophy, even though there is an edit button on Twitter
now. Oh, what a strange world we are living in. Editing tweets? What the fuck?!
What happened to simplicity? What happened to tradition?

Maybe the right approach to editing has always been the ninja edit: glance over
it, do a sanity check for ten seconds but don't overthink it. Fear is not the
mind-killer. Overthinking is. And if your editor sucks, the mind-killer is
editing.
