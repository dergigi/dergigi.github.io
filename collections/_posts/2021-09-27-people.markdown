People are the most wonderful thing. Full of potential, full of joy, full of
wonder. Whenever I see people, I see dancers, artists, musicians, builders,
gardeners, plumbers, and poets. Unique human beings, with hearts and souls, and
mothers and fathers, and wishes and dreams.

Every time I meet new people, I am amazed by their stories. I am fascinated by
their past as well as by their potential future. They will share all of this
with you, right here, in the present, as long as you are present with them.

We must not forget that most people are good. They have to be; otherwise, the
world we live in would not be possible. We would have constant war, and death,
and deception, and suffering, and worse. But we don't. The world is alright
because the people are alright. We must not forget that this is true, so I will
repeat it once more for emphasis: most people are good people.
