Creativity is a mystery. It is creation, inspiration, and—of
course—transpiration. You actually have to sit down and _do_ the thing. You have
to _be_ creative. But what does it mean, "to be creative?"

A creative solution is a new solution, a non-obvious solution. It might be
obvious in hindsight, but it is non-obvious at present. Only a _genius_ can come
up with a new, non-obvious solution. The genius is creative. By definition.

According to _The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language_, a genius
is someone who has "extraordinary intellectual and creative power." There it is
again: creativity. Creativity is power. Creativity is genius.

> genius (n.) - late 14c., "tutelary or moral spirit" who guides and governs an
> individual through life, from Latin genius "guardian deity or spirit which
> watches over each person from birth; spirit, incarnation; wit, talent;" also
> "prophetic skill; the male spirit of a gens," originally "generative power"
> (or "inborn nature"), from PIE *gen(e)-yo-, from root *gene- "give birth,
> beget," with derivatives referring to procreation and familial and tribal
> groups.
>
> genie (n.) - 1650s, "tutelary spirit," from French génie, from Latin genius
> (see genius); used in French translation of "Arabian Nights" to render Arabic
> jinni, singular of jinn, which it accidentally resembled, and attested in
> English with this sense from 1748.

I've become enamoured with words, something I never thought that would happen to
me. It is beyond fascinating to understand them, the metaphors they refer to,
and how they transformed over time. I used to smile at linguists and
etymologists. It was never interesting to me, and now I can't seem to stop.

All word is metaphor; and even though not all forms of understanding are
linguistic, all understanding is metaphor in disguise. We use words that mean
one thing to construct more words that mean another thing. We use what is
understood in a solid way to build up constructs that further our understanding,
our "standing under." That's why any manipulation of language is so dangerous:
it erodes the foundation of the skyscrapers that make up the skyline of our
shared worldview. The protective constructs we find ourselves in, that give us
shelter. Our structures of understanding.

Creativity is expression. Of course, there is more to expression than just
words. Art and dance and music are the obvious ones. Mathematics, programming
engineering, skateboarding, and rock climbing are some of the less obvious ones.
Truly creative people seem to be _possessed_ by whatever they are doing;
possessed by a goal, or a feeling, or an idea, or a spirit. There he is again,
the génie, the jinn, the spirit that comes out of the oil lamp that illuminates
that which would otherwise be dark.

> possess (v.) - late 14c., possessen, "to hold, occupy, inhabit" (without
> regard to ownership), a back formation from possession and in part from Old
> French possesser "to have and hold, take, be in possession of" (mid-13c.),
> from Latin possessus, past participle of possidere "to have and hold, hold in
> one's control, be master of, own," probably a compound of potis "having power,
> powerful, able" (from PIE root *poti- "powerful; lord") + sedere, from PIE
> root *sed- (1) "to sit."
>
> obsess (v.) - c. 1500, "to besiege" (a sense now obsolete), from Latin
> obsessus, past participle of obsidere "watch closely; besiege, occupy; stay,
> remain, abide" literally "sit opposite to," from ob "against" (see ob-) +
> sedere "to sit," from PIE root *sed- (1) "to sit." Of evil spirits, "to
> haunt," from 1530s.

It took me a long time to realize that I am obsessed with words. Words that hold
value, first and foremost. Words in general, as of late. And, more recently,
words that generate images. Words that somehow, magically, rearrange pixels to
produce something that never existed before. Something that will never be
generated again in exactly the same way. Something mesmerising.

Is creativity still valuable when it is generated? What is the difference
between a creative solution devised by man, a creative solution devised by
nature, and a creative solution devised by machine? Are evolutionary algorithms
implemented in silica less real than evolutionary algorithms implemented in
flesh and blood? Are the models that are birthed and killed by neural networks
less real than the models in our heads? What is a model but a useful
abstraction? What is a writer but a creative text-completion engine?

"But it lacks soul," I hear you shouting in protest. "It lacks human feeling."

But is that so? Can't machines create something soulful? How do we _know_ that
they create without _feeling_ and _passion_, but with passionless objectivity?

"But it is still just an algorithm."
"Ah, but this algorithm is designed by a human."
"Yes, but the machine is still just a machine."
"Ah, but it has been designed by the human rather than one of its machines."
"Yes, but that human is still a human and not an algorithm."
"Ah, but what is human creativity but an algorithm?"

"Stop!" you cry, and the argument ceases. I have won. "The algorithms are the
same. Both are still just algorithms. The difference is inconsequential. It
means nothing. What matters is what they are designed to do." A computer is a
machine that computes. Does that make it any less real?

"But it still lacks soul!" I hear you shouting in protest, again. "It cannot
capture our imagination. It is just another means to an end."

I beg to differ. Like the author, it is a tool, a set of rules. You can craft it
to be as complex and precise as you like. And like the author, it can inspire a
work of art, or a work of craft. It can make you laugh, or teach you a lesson,
or give you the tools to create the same. Most importantly, it can inspire the
artist, the craftsman, the writer. It can _create_ the soul. It can create new
forms. It can create new methods. It can create new media.

But you are right: It is not as good as an author, yet.

An algorithm, even a well-designed algorithm, is less powerful than an author
because it lacks the complexity of the original. An algorithm lacks the range of
imagination of the original. An algorithm is only as good as its data.

That's fair. My point is, that every artist has a voice, but it's not
necessarily his own. If it's not his voice, whose voice is it? The answer is, it
is the voice of the muse. It is God's voice. It is the voice that we hear in the
story. It is the voice that we hear in the hymns and in the Scriptures. The
voice of the muse is the most important voice. The words of God speak to our
minds, but they most definitely speak to our hearts. If it is not the voice of
God, then what is it? I don't know the answer, but we are missing something big
if it is not God speaking.[^fn-god-speaking]

"It lacks soul." It may be that you believe this not because you know better,
but because in the face of new innovations you no longer trust yourself to
appreciate their impact or to be in the right place to appreciate it. The pace
of innovation is so rapid that even those who love to experiment with new things
often lack the nerve to embrace the new before it has found its feet.[^fn-new-innovations]

"A poem isn't just a box of words." True, but if it isn't also creative, what
exactly is it? Isn't poetry itself a creative act? Why is it that poetry is
considered to be a spiritual enterprise, a high-brow thing for high-brow people?
Isn't poetry in the end but a set of creative conventions?[^fn-box-of-words]

What is creativity then? How do we define it? The creativity I speak of is not
something that just happens to creative people. It is their way of solving
problems and it is part of who they are. It is their soul.[^fn-their-soul]

But what if there is no soul? Is that any better? Is there still room for art?
Is creativity lost once it is not produced by a brain? Can a machine write a
better poem than an individual poet? What makes a creation good? I don't think a
good answer can be given for any of these questions.[^fn-no-soul]

Who am I, as an author? Who are we, as humanity? One thing is certain: we lack
neither creativity nor spirit. We are made of love. If we're machines, we're
machines that love. And a machine that loves is never a machine in any real
sense. And we are not meant to be machines.[^fn-made-of-love]

We are meant to create, which, of course, is the root of all creativity.
