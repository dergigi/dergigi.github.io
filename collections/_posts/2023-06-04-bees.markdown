Bees are marvelous creatures. As are most creatures, I guess.

Without bees, there wouldn't be any flowers. Without flowers, there wouldn't be
any bees.

I was walking along a beautiful path today, as I do most days. To think, enjoy,
meander. An intense buzzing stopped me in my tracks. Bees. Hundreds of them.
Possibly thousands. Busying themselves with the things that bees busy
themselves. It was a sight to behold. The sound? Overwhelming.

The older I get, the more I realize that we are more like bees or ants than we
are like wolves or sheep. Busying ourselves with the things only humans busy
themselves with, mostly oblivious towards the larger structures we are embedded
in. Effective in large groups. Borderline useless when truly alone. Isolation
kills bee, ant, and human alike.

But the busyness is what got me. We are all so busy, myself included, that we
almost never have time to stop, take a breath, and marvel at the bees.
