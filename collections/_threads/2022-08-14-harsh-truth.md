"We are all in this together," they say.

If you think that
maximalists are siding with the state, you are literally retarded, and
I'm not even sorry for saying that. It's a harsh truth that you better
learn now than later.

For years now
bitcoiners have been trying to warn you guys that (a) decentralization
is actually important (b) good opsec is paramount (c) the whole point is
the separation of money and state, nothing else.

This is not a game,
as is hopefully becoming more evident by the day. It's not all unicorns
and happy paths, it's fucking velociraptors that will maul you to death
at the first chance they get.

What happened to
the TC dev is absolutely disgusting, and no bitcoiner I know is cheering
for it. To the contrary, many high-profile bitcoiners have spoken out
about the insanity of the legal precedent it sets.

Either code is
speech or it isn't. Either free speech means something or it doesn't.
Either peaceful civilians are allowed to send messages to each other or
not. If not, the authoritarians show their cards clearly, and so be it.


The whole fucking
point of bitcoin is that WHAT AUTHORITARIANS THINK DOES NOT MATTER, it
is resilient from the ground up, censorship-resistant from first
principles.

This is why it is
important that people can run full nodes, cheaply. This is why
open-source and self-sovereign tools are essential. This is why
decentralization actually matters. This is why PoW is used.

Maximalists should
absolutely be dunking on DeFi, because DeFi is CeFi and CeFi can be
killed easily. When it comes to the separation of money and state, [ONLY
THE STRONG WILL SURVIVE][OTSWS].

You guys have been
building literal Ponzi schemes and house of cards on quicksand, as the
recent "yield" disaster has clearly shown. You are, mostly, still
playing games and acting as if everyone will play nice always in
perpetuity, like the ignorant and naive fools you are.

It's all
tradeoffs, always, all the way down. Yes, currently, most bitcoin devs
are known. Some aren't, however, and as state-attacks increase people
will be more nym going forward, hopefully. Also, bitcoin doesn't depend
on devs.

Bitcoin is getting
more resilient over time, because the people that are working on it
actually understand what is at stake, how sophisticated attacks could
look like, and prepare for that. Shitcoins are becoming more efficient
too, but only at separating fools from their money.

I dunk on "DeFi"
because it is centralized dogshit that can be shut down with a blog post
or a phone call. I dunk on shitcoiners because they will throw bitcoin
(and bitcoiners) under the bus first chance they get, all while claiming
"we're in this together!"

No, we are not in
this together. The bitcoiners I care about do not care about yield or
fiat gains. They care about fixing the money, which means separating the
money from the state, or anyone else for that matter.

What I see in
shitcoin land is the opposite of that. Everyone can print money, words
don't matter (dEcEnTRaLiZeD), "principals" are worthless, and
somehow, even though everything competes for liquidity, "we are not
competing with bitcoin" (until we are).

Don't mistake my
hate for shitcoins as "Schadenfreude," because that's not it. The
state will come for all of us, low-hanging fruits first. Bitcoiners
always knew this. You are the guy who just had a corpse land on his
windshield, waking up to what is happening.
