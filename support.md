First of all: thank you for your support. It is because of people like you why I
am able to do what I do. All my work is released for free under a [cc-by-sa
license][license] and provided on a [value for value][value] basis.

The idea of value for value is simple: information is provided free of charge,
directly, without any paywalls or middlemen. If the information was valuable to
you, you are encouraged to give value back.

Some give 10 sats, some give 21 EUR, some give [$100 USD][100] or more. It's
completely up to you.

How much value did you get out of it? Pack of chewing gum? Good meal? Night at
the movies? üçø It's a weird and unusual concept, but somehow it works. And
there's more to it than just money.

### Time, Talent, Treasure

If you can't part with your hard-earned sats, consider giving back with your
time or talent instead.  For example, you can share one of my [articles][words]
or work on a [translation][translations].

### Recurring Support

Recurring support to pay the monthly bills is highly appreciated. Unfortunately,
there is no good way to do recurring payments with bitcoin yet. Which is why I
still have to use fiat platforms.

### Meatspace Support

Physical goods behave differently than information, so if you want to purchase
atoms that exist because of me, buying [my book][21lessons] is a good option.
