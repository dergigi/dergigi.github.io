First of all: thank you for your support. It is because of people like you why I
am able to do what I do. All my work is released for free under an [open and
permissive license][license] and provided on a [value for value][value] basis.

### Recurring Support

Recurring support to pay the monthly bills is highly appreciated. Unfortunately,
there is no good way to do recurring payments with bitcoin yet. Which is why I
still have to use fiat platforms.[^fn-oak]

[^fn-oak]: There are some promising developments, such as [Oak Node](https://oak-node.net/doc/trunk/README.md) and [Bolt12](https://bolt12.org/ux-design#reusable-payment-requests) recurring payments.

### Direct Support

The idea is simple: information is provided free of charge, directly, without
any paywalls or middlemen. If the information was valuable to you, you are
encouraged to give value back.

How much value did you get out of it? Pack of chewing gum? Good meal? Night at
the movies? üçø It's a weird and unusual concept, but somehow it works. And
there's more to it than just money. It's about [time, talent, and treasure][value].

Some give 10 sats, some give 21 EUR, some give [$100 USD][100], [1 BTC][1btc], or more. It's
completely up to you.

### Meatspace Support

Physical goods behave differently than information, so if you want to purchase
atoms that exist because of me, buying [my book][21lessons] is a good option.

### Lightning Support

You can send an arbitrary amount of sats to [s@ts.dergigi.com][sats] or one of
my other lightning addresses.[^ln-addr] If you have a wallet that supports
Bolt12,[^ln-bolt12] you can use the following reusable payment request:

specific article---you can!
