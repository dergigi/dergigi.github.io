Gigi is the author of [21 Lessons](https://21lessons.com/), a popular book about
lessons learned from falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole.  His current
work-in-progress book, [21 Ways](https://21-ways.com/), tries to illuminate
Bitcoin from multiple angles, using metaphors from biology, physics,
engineering, and other disciplines. He is the creator and maintainer
of [bitcoin-resources.com](https://bitcoin-resources.com/), a comprehensive list
of curated books, articles, podcasts, and other resources that help to provide a
multi-faceted understanding of Bitcoin.  In 2019 he launched the German-speaking
Bitcoin podcast \"[Einundzwanzig](https://einundzwanzig.space/)\" with one of
his co-hosts which turned into a community movement that now spans [multiple
countries](https://twentyone.world/). He is passionate about privacy, human
rights, and freedom technology. As the head of strategy and operations
of [OpenSats](https://opensats.org/), he spends most of his day thinking about
how to best support the development of free and open-source software as we
transition towards an increasingly bitcoinized world.
