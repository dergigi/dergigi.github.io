Gigi is the author of [21 Lessons](https://21lessons.com/), a popular book about
lessons learned from falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. His current
work-in-progress book, [21 Ways](https://21-ways.com/), tries to illuminate
Bitcoin from multiple angles, using metaphors from biology, physics,
engineering, and other disciplines. In addition to writing books he launched
and contributed to [various projects](https://dergigi.com/projects) over the years.

He is the creator and maintainer
of [bitcoin-resources.com](https://bitcoin-resources.com/) and
[nostr-resources.com](https://nostr-resources.com), a comprehensive list of
curated books, articles, podcasts, and other resources that help to provide a
multi-faceted understanding of Bitcoin & nostr.

In 2019 he launched the German-speaking Bitcoin podcast
\"[Einundzwanzig](https://einundzwanzig.space/)\" with one of his co-hosts which
turned into a community movement that now spans [multiple
countries](https://twentyone.world/). In 2023 he launched [Sovereign
Engineering](https://sovereignengineering.io/), a program for freedom tech
builders that is dedicated to high-bandwidth collaboration, in-person
communication, and iterative experimentation. He is passionate about privacy,
human rights, and freedom technology.

As the head of strategy and operations at [OpenSats](https://opensats.org/), he
spends most of his day thinking about how to best support the development of
free and open-source software as we transition towards an increasingly
bitcoinized world.
