Words have to be one of the greatest inventions of mankind. Granted, it's a
stretch to say that the spoken word was invented. The written word, however,
undoubtedly was.

Books are indeed proof that humans are capable of working magic. I wonder what
Carl's thoughts would be on the technology of today, some of which is truly
indistinguishable from magic.

Performing magic, or in this case, properly expressing one's thoughts in
writing, is *hard*. Writing forces you to structure your thoughts. Structuring
your thoughts - and by extension, yourself - can be a painful process.

Painful, because you actually don't want to put in the work to clean up your
thoughts, exactly *because* it is work. The option of not doing this work is a
comfortable one. The option of ignoring any holes in your reasoning is too.

It is so easy to convince yourself that your reasoning is sound. That you have
it all figured out. "The easiest person to fool is yourself," to paraphrase
Richard Feynman. Knowing that you can be fooled easily and that you can also
easily fool yourself is not only helpful -- it is the root of the scientific
method.

I've had many conversations in the last couple of weeks, some of which related
to questions of certainty and doubt. I love meeting people who are fully
convinced of something. No matter what it is, I'm always intrigued. Don't get me
wrong, I have strong convictions as well, but I'm more than willing to entertain
the question: "What if I'm wrong?"

Many people do not entertain the idea that they could be wrong. I wouldn't go as
far as Bertrand Russel and call them stupid -- because I don't think they are. I
was cocksure about things too, some years ago. What changed? I do not think that
I got smarter. I just learned certain tricks, just like a magician learns magic
tricks.

One of those tricks is very useful to check your level of conviction: ask
yourself what it would take to change your mind. What would it take for you to
admit that you are wrong? Sometimes, it is also a great way to check the depth
of your understanding.

The more I write, the more blind-spots I keep finding in my understanding. The
more I write, the less I am convinced that I have it all figured out. The more I
write, the greater my respect for any successful writer. The more I write,
however, the more I am convinced of the power of words and ideas.

> “No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world.”

What would it take to convince me of the opposite? And with that, the magician
vanishes...
