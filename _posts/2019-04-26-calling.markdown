The past few months I followed a strange calling. There were certain things
I knew I _had_ to do. These callings are a very strange thing, and I find
myself in a pickle, trying to explain them rationally.

The last few weeks I decided to listen to my inner voice and follow my
calling. I worked as hard as I could on the things that I feel are
meaningful, and it felt great. I feel alive and free once more.

Where this journey leads I don't know.
