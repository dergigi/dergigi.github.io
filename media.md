Over the last couple of years, I had the pleasure of speaking on various
podcasts, conferences, and live shows to talk about Bitcoin and its
implications. While the conversations mostly revolve around Bitcoin, they
sometimes stray into other, related topics.

In the hectic world of today, it is often challenging to find the time to read
long articles and books, which is why I love podcasts and recorded conversations
of all kinds. If you do too, here are some
[conversations](#interviews-and-conversations) and [talks](#talks) where I share
my thoughts about Bitcoin. There are also some [guest posts](#guest-posts)
and popular [twitter threads](#twitter-threads) linked at
the bottom of this page.
