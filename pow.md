Bitcoin's difficulty-adjusted proof-of-work is the innovation. Without it, trustless
digital scarcity and immutability is impossible.

Read the following, in order:

1. [A failure to understand proof of work is a failure to understand Bitcoin][tw-pow]
2. [Memes vs The World][tw-meme-world] - How information differs from physical objects
3. [Bitcoin is Time][time] - How Bitcoin decentralizes time itself
4. [Bitcoin's Energy Consumption][energy] - A shift in perspective
