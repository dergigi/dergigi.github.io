Time is money, or so the saying goes. It follows that money is also
time: a repre­sen­ta­tion of the collec­tive economic energy stored by
humanity. However, the link between time and money is more intri­cate
than it might seem at first. If money requires no time to create, it
doesn't work as money very well, or not for long. More profoundly, as we
shall see, keeping track of things in the infor­ma­tional realm always
implies keeping track of time.

As soon as money goes digital, we have to agree on a *defin­i­tion of
time*, and herein lies the whole problem. You might think telling the
time is as easy as glancing at whatever clock is nearby, and you would
be right when it comes to everyday tasks. But when it comes to
synchro­nizing the state of a global, adver­sarial, distrib­uted
network, telling the time becomes an almost intractable problem. How do
you tell the time if clocks can't be trusted? How do you create the
concept of a singular time if your system spans the galaxy? How do you
measure time in a timeless realm? And what is time anyway? 

To answer these questions, we will have to take a closer look at the
concept of time itself and how Bitcoin makes up its own time: block
time --- more commonly known as *block height*. We will explore why the
problem of timekeeping is intimately related to keeping records, why
there is no absolute time in a decen­tral­ized system, and how Bitcoin
uses causality and unpre­dictability to build its own sense of now. 

Timekeeping devices have trans­formed civiliza­tions more than once. As
Lewis Mumford pointed out in 1934: "The clock, not the steam-engine, is
the key-machine of the modern indus­trial age." Today, it is again
a timekeeping device that is trans­forming our civiliza­tion: a clock,
not computers, is the true key-machine of the modern infor­ma­tional
age. And this clock is Bitcoin.

Very broadly speaking, there are two ways to keep track of things:
physical tokens and ledgers. You can either use real-world artifacts
directly, e.g., give someone a sea shell, a coin, or some other tangible
*thing*, or you can repli­cate the state of the world by writing down
what happened on a piece of paper. 

Imagine you are a shepherd and want to make sure that your whole flock
returned home. You can put a collar on each sheep, and as soon as
a sheep returns home, you simply remove the collar and hang it up in
your shed. If you have one hanger for every collar, you will know that
every sheep returned safely as soon as all hangers are filled. Of
course, you can also count them and keep a list. However, you will have
to make sure to create a new list every time you start counting, and you
will also have to make sure not to count a single sheep twice (or not at
all).

Money is essen­tially a tool to keep track of who owes what to whom.
Broadly speaking, every­thing we have used as money up to now falls into
two categories: *physical* artifacts and *infor­ma­tional* lists. Or, to
use more common parlance: tokens and ledgers.

{% include image.html name="ledger-token.jpg" %}

It is impor­tant to realize the inherent differ­ence of these
categories, so let me point it out explic­itly: The first
method --- a physical token --- *directly* repre­sents the state of
things. The second one --- a ledger --- *indirectly* reflects the state
of things. Each comes with advan­tages and disad­van­tages. For example,
tokens are physical and distrib­uted; ledgers are infor­ma­tional and
central­ized. Tokens are inher­ently trust­less; ledgers are not.

In the digital realm --- no matter how intensely marketing gurus try to
convince you of the opposite --- we can only use ledgers. It is an
*infor­ma­tional* realm, not a physical one. Even if you call a certain
kind of infor­ma­tion a "token," it is still a malleable piece of
infor­ma­tion, written down on a hard drive or some other medium that
can hold infor­ma­tion, effec­tively rendering it an infor­ma­tional
record.

The ledger-like nature of all digital infor­ma­tion is the root cause of
the double-spend problem. Infor­ma­tion never repre­sents the state of
the world *directly*. Further, the movement of infor­ma­tion implies
copying. Infor­ma­tion exists in one place, and to "move" it, you have
to copy it to another place and erase it at its origin. This problem
doesn't exist in the physical realm. In the physical realm, we can
actually move things from A to B. The infor­ma­tional realm doesn't have
this property. If you want to "move" infor­ma­tion from list A to list
B, you have to copy it from A to B. There is no other way.

Another way to think about it is in terms of unique­ness. Physical
tokens are unique compos­ites of atoms whose assembly is not easily
replic­able. Pure infor­ma­tion does not have this property. If you can
read the infor­ma­tion, you can also copy it perfectly. Practi­cally
speaking, it follows that physical tokens are unique, and digital tokens
are not. I would even argue that "digital token" is a misnomer. A token
might repre­sent secret infor­ma­tion, but it will never repre­sent
unique, singular, uncopy­able infor­ma­tion.

This differ­ence in proper­ties shows that there really is no way to
"hand over" infor­ma­tion. It is impos­sible to pass on a digital token
like you would pass on a physical one since you can never be sure if the
original owner destroyed the infor­ma­tion on his end. Digital tokens,
like all infor­ma­tion, can only be spread, like an idea.

> apples --- we each end up with only one apple. But if you and I have
> an idea and we swap ideas --- we each end up with two ideas.
>
> <cite>Charles F. Brannan (1949)</cite>

Physical tokens --- what we call physical bearer assets, or
"cash" --- are free from this dilemma. In the real world, if you hand me
a coin, your coin is gone. There is no magical dupli­ca­tion of the
coin, and the only way to give it to me is to physi­cally hand it over.
The laws of physics do not allow you to double-spend it.

While double-spending does exist in the non-digital realm --- George
Parker, a con artist who famously "double-spent" the Brooklyn Bridge and
other landmarks comes to mind --- it requires elabo­rate decep­tion and
gullible buyers. Not so in the digital realm. 

In the digital realm, because we are always dealing with
*infor­ma­tion,* double-spending is an *inherent* problem. As everyone
who ever copied a file or used copy-and-paste knows, infor­ma­tion is
something that you can copy *perfectly*, and it is not bound to the
medium that hosts it. If you have a digital photo­graph, for example,
you can copy it a million times, store some copies on a USB stick, and
send it to thousands of different people. Perfect copies are possible
because infor­ma­tion allows for flawless error correc­tion, which
elimi­nates degra­da­tion. And to top things off, there is virtu­ally no
cost to dupli­ca­tion and no way to tell what the original was.

Again: when it comes to infor­ma­tion, copying is all there is. There
simply is no way to *move* digital infor­ma­tion from A to B.
Infor­ma­tion is always *copied* from A to B, and if the copying process
was successful, the original copy of A is deleted. This is why the
double-spending problem is so tricky. Absent of a central authority,
there is no way to move *anything* from A to B in a trust­less manner.
You always have to trust that the original will be deleted. A natural
side-effect is that, when it comes to digital infor­ma­tion, it is
*impos­sible* to tell how many copies are in existence and where these
copies might be.

Because of this, using digital "tokens" as money can not and will never
work. Since tokens derive their relia­bility from being hard to
repro­duce as a result of their unique physical construc­tion, this
advan­tage disap­pears in the digital realm. In the digital realm,
tokens cannot be trusted. As a result of the nature of infor­ma­tion's
intrinsic proper­ties, the only viable format for digital money is not
a token but a ledger --- which brings us to the problem of time.

## Tokens Are Timeless, Ledgers Are Not

> For the things seen are tempo­rary, but the things unseen are
> everlasting.
>
> <cite>Paul of Tarsus, *Corinthians* 4:18b</cite>

When it comes to physical tokens, the time of a trans­ac­tion does not
matter. You either have the coins in your pocket, or you don't; you can
either spend them, or you can't. The simple act of posses­sion is the
only prereq­ui­site for spending. The laws of nature take care of the
rest. In that sense, physical tokens are trust­less and timeless.

When it comes to ledgers, physical posses­sion falls to the wayside.
Whoever is in control of the ledger needs to make sure that things are
*in order*. What is other­wise given by physical laws, namely that you
can't spend money that you don't have and you can't spend money that you
have already spent previ­ously, has to be enforced by man-made rules. It
is these rules that govern the orderly opera­tion and mainte­nance of
a ledger, not physical laws. 

Moving from physical laws to man-made rules is the crux of the matter.
Man-made rules can be bent and broken, physical laws not so much. For
example, you can't simply "make up" a physical gold coin. You have to
dig it out of the ground. You can, however, absolutely make up a gold
coin on paper. To do this, you simply add an entry to the ledger and
give yourself a couple of coins. Or, in the case of central banks,
simply add a couple trillion with a few computer keystrokes. (Fancy
finan­cial people call this "Rehypoth­e­ca­tion," "Fractional Reserve
Banking," or "Quanti­ta­tive Easing" --- but don't be fooled, it's all
the same: making up money.)

To keep ledgers and those who manip­u­late them honest, regular,
indepen­dent audits are required. The ability to account for every
single entry in a ledger is not a luxury. Auditors need to be able to go
over the books --- backward in time --- to keep ledgers honest and
functioning. Without reliable timestamps, verifying the internal
consis­tency of a ledger is impos­sible. A mecha­nism to estab­lish an
unambiguous order is essen­tial.

Without an absolute sense of time, there is no way to have a defined
order of trans­ac­tion. And without a defined order of trans­ac­tions,
the rules of a ledger can not be followed. How else can you make sure
how much money you actually have? How else can you make sure that things
are *in order*?

The distinc­tion between tokens and ledgers highlights the neces­sity
for keeping track of time. In the physical realm, coins are timeless
artifacts that can be exchanged without oversight. In the digital realm,
coinstamping requires timestamping.

## Centralized Coinstamping

>
> <cite>Yahia Lababidi (b. 1973)</cite>

The common way to solve the double-spending problem --- the problem of
making sure that a digital transfer only happens once --- is to have
a central list of trans­ac­tions. Once you have a central list of
trans­ac­tions, you have a single ledger that can act as the sole source
of truth. Solving the double-spending problem is as easy as going
through the list and making sure that every­thing adds up correctly.
This is how PayPal, Venmo, Alipay, and all the banks of this
world --- including central banks --- solve the double-spending problem:
via central authority.

It is worth pointing out that Satoshi didn't manage to make
infor­ma­tion non-copyable. Every part of bitcoin --- its source code,
the ledger, your private key --- can be copied. All of it can be
dupli­cated and tampered with. However, Satoshi managed to build
a system that makes rule-breaking copies completely and utterly useless.
The Bitcoin network performs an intri­cate dance to decide which copies
are useful and which aren't, and it is this dance that brings scarcity
into the digital realm. And like with every dance, a temporal measuring
stick is required to dictate the rhythm.

Even a central­ized ledger can only solve the double-spending problem if
it has a consis­tent way to keep track of time. You always need to know
who gave how much to whom and, most impor­tantly: *when*. In the realm
of infor­ma­tion, there is no coin-stamping without time-stamping.

## Decentralized Time

> <cite>Aeschylus (525 BC -- 456 BC)</cite>

Time and order have a very intimate relation­ship. As Leslie Lamport
pointed out in his 1978 paper *Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events
in a Distrib­uted System*: "The concept of time is funda­mental to our
way of thinking. It is derived from the more basic concept of the order
in which events occur." Absent a central point of coordi­na­tion,
seemingly intuitive notions of "before," "after," and
"simul­ta­ne­ously" break down. In the words of Lamport: "the concept of
'happening before' defines an invariant partial ordering of the events
in a distrib­uted multi­process system."

Phrased differ­ently: Who should be in charge of time if putting someone
in charge is not allowed? How can you have a reliable clock if there is
no central frame of refer­ence?

You might think that solving this problem is easy because everyone could
just use their own clock. This only works if every­one's clock is
accurate, and, more impor­tantly, everyone plays nice. In an
adver­sarial system, relying on individual clocks would be a disaster.
And, because of relativity, it does not work consis­tently across space.

As a thought exper­i­ment, imagine how you could cheat the system if
everyone was in charge of keeping the time for themselves. You could
pretend that the trans­ac­tion you're sending now is actually from
yesterday --- it just got delayed for some reason --- thus, you would
still have all the money that you've spent today. Because of the
asynchro­nous commu­ni­ca­tion that is inherent in every decen­tral­ized
system, this scenario is more than a theoret­ical thought exper­i­ment.
Messages do indeed get delayed, timestamps are inaccu­rate, and thanks
to relativistic effects and the natural speed limit of our universe, it
is anything but easy to tell apart the order of things absent of
a central authority or observer.

> Who's there? Knock knock.
>
> <cite>An Asynchro­nous Joke</cite>

To better illus­trate the impos­si­bility of the problem, let's look at
a concrete example. Imagine that you and your business partner both have
access to your company bank account. You do business all over the world,
so your bank account is in Switzer­land, you are in New York, and your
business partner is in Sydney. For you, it is January 3^rd^, and you are
enjoying a beautiful Sunday evening at your hotel. For her, it's Monday
morning already, so she decides to buy break­fast using the debit card
of your shared bank account. The cost is \$27. The avail­able balance is
\$615. The local time is 8:21 am.

At the same time, you are about to pay for your stay with another debit
card linked to the same bank account. The cost is \$599. The avail­able
balance is \$615. The local time is 5:21 pm.

{% include image.html name="alice-bob-bank.jpg" %}

So it comes to be that --- at exactly the same moment --- you both swipe
the card. What happens? (Dear physi­cists, please excuse my use of "the
same moment" --- we will ignore relativistic effects and the fact that
there is no absolute time in our universe for now. We will also ignore
that the concept of synchro­nous events doesn't really exist. Bitcoin is
compli­cated enough as it is!)

The central ledger at your bank will probably receive one trans­ac­tion
before the other one, so one of you will be lucky, the other not so
much. If the trans­ac­tions happen to arrive in the same
*tick* --- let's say in the same millisecond --- the bank would have to
decide who gets to spend the money.

Now, what would happen if there was no bank? Who decides who was the
first one to swipe? What if it wasn't only you two, but hundreds or even
thousands of people coordi­nating? What if you didn't trust those
people? What if some of those people are trying to cheat, e.g., by
setting their clocks back so that it looks like they spent the money
a couple of minutes earlier?

This problem is *precisely* why all previous attempts of digital cash
required a central­ized registry. You always had to trust someone to
correctly identify the order of things. A central­ized party was
required to keep the time.

Bitcoin solves this problem by re-inventing time itself. It says no to
seconds and yes to blocks.

All clocks rely on periodic processes, something that we might call a
"tick." The familiar *tick-tock* of a grand­fa­ther's clock is, in
essence, the same as the molec­ular-atomic buzzing of our modern Quartz
and Caesium clocks. Something swings --- or oscil­lates --- and we simply
count these swings until it adds up to a minute or a second.

For large pendulum clocks, these swings are long and easy to see. For
smaller and more special­ized clocks, special equip­ment is required.
The frequency of a clock --- how often it ticks --- depends on its
use-case.

Most clocks have a fixed frequency. After all, we want to know the time
*precisely*. There are, however, clocks that have a variable frequency.
A metronome, for example, has a variable frequency that you can set
before you make it tick. While a metronome keeps its pace constant once
it is set, Bitcoin's time varies for each tick because its internal
mecha­nism is proba­bilistic. The purpose, however, is all the same:
keep the music alive, so the dance can continue.

| Clock                     | Tick Frequency                          |
| --------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Grandfather's clock       | \~0.5 Hz                                |
| Metronome                 | \~0.67 Hz to \~4.67 Hz                  |

The fact that Bitcoin is a clock is hiding in plain sight. Indeed,
Satoshi points out that the Bitcoin network as a whole acts as a clock,
or, in his words: a distrib­uted timestamp server.

That timestamping was the root problem to be solved is also apparent by
examining the refer­ence at the end of the Bitcoin whitepaper. Out of
the eight refer­ences in total, three are about timestamping:

-   *How to time-stamp a digital document* by S. Haber, W.S.
    Stornetta (1991)
-   *Improving the efficiency and relia­bility of digital time-stamping*
    by D. Bayer, S. Haber, W.S. Stornetta (1992)
-   *Design of a secure timestamping service with minimal trust
    require­ments* by H. Massias, X.S. Avila, and J.-J. Quisquater
    (May 1999)

As Haber and Stornetta outlined in 1991, digital time-stamping is about
compu­ta­tion­ally practical proce­dures that make it infea­sible for
a user --- or an adver­sary, for that matter --- to either back-date or
forward-date a digital document. Contrary to physical documents, digital
documents are easy to tamper with, and the change doesn't neces­sarily
leave any tell-tale signs on the physical medium itself. In the digital
realm, forgeries and manip­u­la­tions can be perfect.

The malleable nature of infor­ma­tion makes time-stamping digital
documents an elabo­rate and sophis­ti­cated process. Naive solutions do
not work. Take a text document, for example. You can't simply add the
date at the end of the document since everyone --- including
yourself --- could simply change the date in the future. You could also
make up any date in the first place.

## Time is a Causal Chain

> nothing else.
>
> <cite>Tim Berners-Lee, *Weaving the Web* (1999)</cite>

Making up dates is a general problem, even in the non-digital realm.
What is known in the kidnap­ping world as "Authen­ti­ca­tion by
Newspaper" is a general solution to the problem of arbitrary timestamps.

{% include image.html name="proof-of-time.jpg" caption="Proof of Time" %}

This works because a newspaper is hard to fake and easy to verify. It is
hard to fake because today's front page refers to yester­day's events,
events that could not have been predicted by the kidnapper if the
picture would be weeks old. By proxy of these events, the picture is
proof that the hostage was still alive on the day the newspaper came
out.

This method highlights one of the key concepts when it comes to time:
*causality*. The arrow of time describes the causal relation­ship of
events. No causality, no time. Causality is also the reason why
crypto­graphic hash functions are so crucial when it comes to
timestamping documents in cyber­space: they intro­duce a causal
relation­ship. Since it is practi­cally impos­sible to create a valid
crypto­graphic hash without having the document in the first place,
a causal relation­ship between the document and the hash is intro­duced:
the data in question existed first, the hash was gener­ated later. In
other words: without the compu­ta­tional irreversibility of one-way
functions, there would be no causality in cyber­space.

{% include image.html name="sha256.jpg" caption="A before B" %}

With this causal building block in place, one can come up with schemes
that create a chain of events, causally linking A to B to C and so on.
In that sense, secure digital timestamping moves us from a timeless
place in the ether into the realm of digital history.

> <cite>Bayer, Haber, Stornetta (1992)</cite>

It goes without saying that causality is of the utmost impor­tance when
it comes to economic calcu­la­tions. And since a ledger is nothing but
the embod­i­ment of economic calcu­la­tions of multiple cooper­ating
partic­i­pants, causality is essen­tial for every ledger.

It is fasci­nating that all of the puzzle pieces that make Bitcoin work
did already exist. As early as 1991, Haber and Stornetta intro­duced two
schemes that make it "diffi­cult or impos­sible to produce false
time-stamps." The first relies on a trusted third party; the second,
more elabo­rate "distrib­uted trust" scheme, does not. The authors even
identi­fied the inherent problems of trusting a causal chain of events
and what would be required to rewrite history. In their words, "the only
possible spoof is to prepare a fake chain of time-stamps, long enough to
exhaust the most suspi­cious challenger that one antic­i­pates."
A similar attack vector exists in Bitcoin today, in the form of a 51%
attack (more on that in a later chapter).

One year later, Bayer, Haber, and Stornetta built upon their previous
work and proposed to use trees instead of simple linked lists to tie
events together. What we know as *Merkle Trees* today are simply
efficient data struc­tures to create a hash from multiple hashes
deter­min­is­ti­cally. For timestamping, this means that you can
efficiently bundle multiple events into one "tick." In the same paper,
the authors propose that the distrib­uted trust model intro­duced in
1991 could be improved by carrying out a recur­ring "world champi­onship
tourna­ment" to deter­mine a single "winner" who widely publishes the
resulting hash somewhere public, like a newspaper. Sounds familiar?

As we shall see, it turns out that newspa­pers are also an excel­lent
way to think about the second ingre­dient of time: unpre­dictability.

## Causality and Unpredictability

> Time is not a reality \[*hupostasis*\], but a concept \[*noêma*\] or

> <cite>Antiphon the Sophist, *On Truth* (3rd century AD)</cite>

While causality is essen­tial, it is not suffi­cient. We also need
*unpre­dictability* for time to flow. In the physical realm, we observe
natural processes to describe the flow of time. We observe a general
increase in entropy and call that the arrow of time. Even though the
laws of nature seem to be obliv­ious in regards to the direc­tion of
this arrow in most cases, certain things can't be undone, practi­cally
speaking. You can't unscramble an egg, as they say.

Similarly, entropy-increasing functions are required to estab­lish an
arrow of time in the digital realm. Just like it is practi­cally
impos­sible to unscramble an egg, it is practi­cally impos­sible to
unscramble a SHA256 hash or crypto­graphic signa­ture. 

Without this increase in entropy, we could go forward and backward in
time willy-nilly. The sequence of Fibonacci Numbers, for example, is
causal but not entropic. Every number in the sequence is caused by the
two numbers that came before it. In that sense, it is a causal chain.
However, it is not useful to tell the time because it is entirely
predictable. In the same way that a kidnapper can't simply stand in
front of a calendar that shows the current date, we can't use
predictable processes as proof of time. We always have to rely on
something that can't be predicted in advance, like the front page of
today's newspaper.

Bitcoin relies upon two sources of unpre­dictability: trans­ac­tions and
proof-of-work. Just like nobody can predict what tomor­row's newspaper
will look like, nobody can predict what the next Bitcoin block will look
like. You can't predict what trans­ac­tions are going to be included
because you can't predict what trans­ac­tions are going to be broad­cast
in the future. And, more impor­tantly, you can't predict who will find
the solution to the current proof-of-work puzzle and what this solution
will be. 

In contrast to the kidnap­per's newspaper, however, proof-of-work is
physi­cally linked to what happened *directly*. It is not just a record
of an event --- it is the event itself. It is the proba­bilistic
direct­ness of proof-of-work that removes trust from the equation. The
only way to find a valid proof-of-work is by making a lot of guesses,
and making a single guess takes a little bit of time. The proba­bilistic
sum of these guesses is what builds up the timechain that is Bitcoin.

By utilizing the causality of hash-chains and the unpre­dictability of
proof-of-work, the Bitcoin network provides a mecha­nism for
estab­lishing an indis­putable history of events witnessed. Without
causality, what came before and what came after is impos­sible to tease
apart. Without unpre­dictability, causality is meaning­less.

What is intuitively under­stood by every kidnapper was explic­itly
pointed out by Bayer, Haber, and Stornetta in 1992: "To estab­lish that
a document was created after a given moment in time, it is neces­sary to
report events that could not have been predicted before they happened."

It is the combi­na­tion of causality and unpre­dictability that allows
the creation of an artifi­cial "now" in the other­wise timeless digital
realm. As Bayer, Haber, and Stornetta point out in their 1991 paper:
"the sequence of clients requesting time-stamps and the hashes they
submit cannot be known in advance. So if we include bits from the
previous sequence of client requests in the signed certifi­cate, then we
know that the time-stamp occurred after these requests. \[...\] But the
require­ment of including bits from previous documents in the
certifi­cate also can be used to solve the problem of constraining the
time in the other direc­tion, because the time-stamping company cannot
issue later certifi­cates unless it has the current request in hand."

All the puzzle pieces were already there. What Satoshi managed to do is
put them together in a way that removes the "time-stamping company" from
the equation.

Let us recapit­u­late: to use money in the digital realm, we have to
rely on ledgers. To make ledgers reliable, unambiguous order is
required. To estab­lish order, timestamps are neces­sary. Thus, if we
want to have *trust­less* money in the digital realm, we must remove any
entity that creates and manages timestamps and any single entity that is
in charge of time itself.

It took a genius like Satoshi Nakamoto to realize the solution: "To
imple­ment a distrib­uted timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we
will need to use a proof-of-work system similar to Adam Back's
Hashcash."

We need to use a proof-of-work system because we need something that is
native to the digital realm. Once you under­stand that the digital realm
is infor­ma­tional in nature, the obvious conclu­sion is that
compu­ta­tion is all we have. If your world is made of data,
manip­u­la­tion of data is all there is. 

Proof-of-work works in a peer-to-peer setting because it is
*trust­less*, and it is trust­less because it is discon­nected from all
external inputs --- such as the readings of clocks (or newspa­pers, for
that matter). It relies on one thing and one thing only: compu­ta­tion
requires work, and in our universe, work requires energy and time.

Without proof-of-work, one would always run into the Oracle problem
because the physical realm and the infor­ma­tional realm are eternally
discon­nected. The markings on your list of sheep aren't your sheep, the
map is not the terri­tory, and whatever was written in yester­day's
newspaper isn't neces­sarily what happened in the real world. In the
same manner, just because you use a real-world clock to write down
a timestamp doesn't mean that this is actually what the time was.

Put bluntly, there simply is no way to trust that data repre­sents
reality, except if the reality in question is inherent in the data
itself. The brilliant thing about Bitcoin's diffi­culty-adjusted
proof-of-work is that it creates its own reality, along with its own
space and time.

Proof-of-work provides a direct connec­tion between the digital realm
and the physical realm. More profoundly, it is the only connec­tion that
can be estab­lished in a trust­less manner. Every­thing else will always
rely on external inputs.

The diffi­culty to mine a new Bitcoin block is adjusted to make sure
that the thin thread between Bitcoin's time and our time remains intact.
Like clock­work, the mining diffi­culty readjusts every 2016 ticks. The
goal of this readjust­ment is to keep the *average* time between ticks
at ten minutes. It is these ten minutes that maintain a stable
connec­tion between the physical and the infor­ma­tional realm.
Conse­quently, a sense of human time is required to readjust the ticks
of the Bitcoin clock. A purely block-based readjust­ment wouldn't work
since it would be completely discon­nected from our human world, and the
whole purpose of the readjust­ment is to stop us ingenious humans from
finding blocks too fast (or too slow).

As Einstein has shown us, time is not a static thing. There is no such
thing as a universal time we could rely upon. Time is relative, and
simul­taneity is nonex­is­tent. This fact alone makes all
timestamps --- especially across large distances --- inher­ently
unreli­able, even without adver­sarial actors. (This is why timestamps
of GPS satel­lites have to be adjusted constantly, by the way.)

For Bitcoin, the fact that our human timestamps are impre­cise doesn't
matter too much. It also doesn't matter that we have no absolute
refer­ence frame in the first place. They only have to be precise enough
to calcu­late a somewhat reliable average across 2016 blocks. To
guarantee that, a block's "meatspace" timestamp is only accepted if it
fulfills two criteria:

1.  The timestamp has to be greater than the median timestamp of the
    previous 11 blocks.
2.  The timestamp has to be less than the network-adjusted time plus two
    hours. (The "network-adjusted time" is simply the median of the
    timestamps returned by all nodes connected to you.)

In other words, the diffi­culty-adjust­ment is about keeping a constant
time, *not* a constant level of security, diffi­culty, or energy
expen­di­ture. This is ingenious because good money *has* to be costly
in time, not energy. Linking money to energy alone is not suffi­cient to
produce absolute scarcity since every improve­ment in energy
gener­a­tion would allow us to create more money. Time is the only thing
we will never be able to make more of. It is *The Ultimate Resource*, as
Julian Simon points out. This makes Bitcoin the ultimate form of money
because its issuance is directly linked to the ultimate resource of our
universe: time.

The diffi­culty adjust­ment is essen­tial because, without it, the
internal clock of Bitcoin would tend to go faster and faster as more
miners join the network or the efficiency of mining devices improves. We
would quickly run into the coordi­na­tion problem that Bitcoin sets out
to solve. As soon as the block time falls below a certain threshold,
say, 50 millisec­onds, it would be impos­sible to agree on a shared
state, even in theory. It takes light around 66 millisec­onds to travel
from one side of the earth to the other. Thus, even if our computers and
routers were perfect, we would be back at square one: given two events,
it would be futile to tell which event happened before and which event
happened after. Without a periodic adjust­ment of Bitcoin's ticks, we
would run into the hopeless problem of solving the coordi­na­tion
problem faster than the speed of light. Time is also at the root of the
problem of crypto­graphic insta­bility, which was outlined in Chapter 1.
Cryptog­raphy works because of an asymmetry in time: it takes a short
time to build a crypto­graphic wall and a long time to break it
down --- unless you have a key.

Thus, in some sense, proof-of-work --- and the diffi­culty adjust­ment
that goes along with it --- artifi­cially slows down time, at least from
the perspec­tive of the Bitcoin network. In other words: Bitcoin
enforces an internal rhythm whose low frequency allows ample buffer for
the latency of commu­ni­ca­tions between peers. Every 2016 blocks,
Bitcoin's internal clock readjusts, so that --- on average --- only one
valid block will be found every 10 minutes. 

From an outside perspec­tive, Bitcoin funnels the chaotic mess of
globally broad­cast asynchro­nous messages into a parallel universe,
restricted by its own rules and its own sense of space and time.
Trans­ac­tions in the mempool are timeless from the point-of-view of the
Bitcoin network. Only when a trans­ac­tion is included in a valid block
does it get assigned a time: the number of the block it is included in.

{% include image.html name="timechain.png" caption="BitCoin v0.01 ALPHA (2009)" %}

It is hard to overstate how elegant a solution this is. Once you are
able to create your own defin­i­tion of time, deciphering what came
before and what came after is trivial. In turn, agreeing on what
happened, in what order, and, conse­quently, who owes what to whom,
becomes trivial as well.

The diffi­culty adjust­ment makes sure that the *ticks* of Bitcoin's
internal metronome are somewhat constant. It is the conductor of the
Bitcoin orchestra. It is what keeps the music alive. 

But why can we rely on work in the first place? The answer is
three­fold. We can rely on it because compu­ta­tion requires work, work
requires time, and the work in question --- guessing random
numbers --- can not be done efficiently.

## Probabilistic Time

> Time forks perpet­u­ally toward innumer­able futures.
>
> <cite>Jorge Luis Borges, *The Garden of Forking Paths* (1941)</cite>

Finding a valid nonce for a Bitcoin block is a guessing game. It is very
much like rolling a die, or flipping a coin, or spinning a roulette
wheel. You are, in essence, trying to find a beyond-astro­nom­i­cally
large random number. There is no progress toward finding a solution. You
either hit the jackpot, or you don't.

Every time you flip a coin, the chance of it coming up heads or tails is
50% --- even if you flipped it twenty times before, and it came up heads
every time. Similarly, every time you wait for a bitcoin block to come
in, the chance that it will be found *this second* is \~0.16%. It
doesn't matter when the last block was found. The approx­i­mate waiting
time for the next block is always the same: \~10 minutes.

It follows that every individual tick of this clock is unpre­dictable.
Relative to our human clocks, this clock appears to be sponta­neous and
impre­cise. This is irrel­e­vant, as Gregory Trubet­skoy points out: "It
doesn't matter that this clock is impre­cise. What matters is that it is
the same clock for everyone and that the state of the chain can be tied
unambigu­ously to the ticks of this clock." Bitcoin's clock might be
proba­bilistic, but it isn't illusory.

> Time is an illusion,\\
> lunchtime doubly so.
>
> <cite>Douglas Adams (1979)</cite>

The present moment, however, can absolutely be an illusion in Bitcoin.
Since there is no central authority in the network, strange situa­tions
can arise. While unlikely, it is possible that two valid blocks are found at
the same time (again: apolo­gies to all physi­cists), which will make
the clock tick forward in two different places at once. However, since
the two different blocks will very likely differ in their content, they
will contain two different histo­ries, both equally valid.

This is known as a chain split and is a natural process of Nakamoto
consensus. Like a flock of birds that briefly splits in two only to
merge again, nodes on the Bitcoin network will eventu­ally converge to
a shared history after some time, thanks to the proba­bilistic nature of
guessing.

Nakamoto consensus simply states that the correct history is to be found
in the heaviest chain, i.e., the chain with the most amount of
proof-of-work embedded in it. Thus, if we have two histo­ries A and B,
some miners will try to build upon history A, others will try to build
upon history B. As soon as one of them finds the next valid block, the
other group is programmed to accept that they were on the wrong side of
history and switch over to the heaviest chain --- the chain that
repre­sents what actually happened, by defin­i­tion. In Bitcoin, history
is truly written by the victors.

In this simple state­ment lies the secret of the distrib­uted
coordi­na­tion problem. This is how Satoshi solved the problem of the
"simul­ta­neous payment" our ficti­tious business partners encoun­tered
previ­ously. He solved it once and for all, relativistic effects be
damned!

Because of this proba­bilistic nature of Bitcoin's clock, the present
moment --- what we call the chain tip --- is always uncer­tain. The
past --- blocks buried below the chain tip --- is ever more certain.

Conse­quently, the Bitcoin clock might rewind from time to time, for
some peers, for a tick or two. If your chain tip --- the present
moment --- happens to lose to a competing chain tip, your clock will
first rewind and then jump forward, overriding the last few ticks that
you thought were history already. If your clock is proba­bilistic, your
under­standing of the past has to be too.

Keeping track of things in the infor­ma­tional realm implies keeping
track of a sequence of events, which in turn requires keeping track of
time. Keeping track of time requires agreeing on a "now" --- a moment in
time that eternally links the settled past with the uncer­tain future.
In Bitcoin, this "now" is the tip of the heaviest proof-of-work chain. 

Two building blocks are essen­tial for the struc­ture of time: causal
links and unpre­dictable events. Causal links are required to define
a past, and unpre­dictable events are required to build a future. If the
sequence of events would be predictable, it would be possible to skip
ahead. If the individual steps of the sequence aren't linked, it would
be trivial to change the past. Because of its internal sense of time, it
is insanely diffi­cult to cheat Bitcoin. One would have to rewrite the
past or predict the future. Bitcoin's timechain prevents both.

Viewing Bitcoin through the lens of time should make clear that the
"block chain" --- the data struc­ture that causally links multiple
events together --- is not the main innova­tion. It is not even a new
idea, as is evident by studying the timestamp liter­a­ture of the past.

> A blockchain is a chain of blocks.
>
> <cite>Peter Todd</cite>

What is a new idea --- what Satoshi figured out --- is how to
indepen­dently agree upon a history of events without central
coordi­na­tion. He found a way to imple­ment a decen­tralised
timestamping scheme that (a) doesn't require a time-stamping company or
server, (b) doesn't require a newspaper or any other physical medium as
proof, and (c) can keep the *ticks* more-or-less constant, even when
operating in an environ­ment of ever-faster CPU clock times.

Timekeeping requires *causality*, *unpre­dictability*, and
*coordi­na­tion*. In Bitcoin, *causality* is provided by one-way
functions: the crypto­graphic hash functions and digital signa­tures
that are at the core of the protocol. *Unpre­dictability* is provided by
both the proof-of-work puzzle as well as the inter­ac­tion with other
peers: you can't know in advance what others are doing, and you can't
know in advance what the solution to the proof-of-work puzzle will be.
*Coordi­na­tion* is made possible by the diffi­culty adjust­ment, the
magic sauce that links Bitcoin's time to ours. Without this bridge
between the physical and the infor­ma­tional realm, it would be
impos­sible to agree on a time by relying on nothing but data.

**Bitcoin is time** in more ways than one. Its units are stored time
because they are money, and its network is time because it is
a decen­tral­ized clock. The relent­less beating of this clock is what
gives rise to all the magical proper­ties of Bitcoin. Without it,
Bitcoin's intri­cate dance would fall apart. But with it, everyone on
earth has access to something truly marvelous: Magic Internet Money.
