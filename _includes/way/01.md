On October 31st, 2008, the future trajectory of our global society was
forever changed. A breakthrough was made, and an unstoppable idea was
let loose on the world. An idea so profound, so outrageous, that it was
ignored by almost everyone for the first couple of years - and is still
dismissed by most: *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*.

The whitepaper released by Satoshi Nakamoto on this Halloween night
describes an idea that will inevitably take the world by storm. While
most people still think of Bitcoin as nothing more than a get-rich-quick
scheme --- completely missing the profound change it will continue to
have on society --- it becomes more obvious every day that it won't go
away.

"Ideas, unlike solid structures, do not perish," Alan Moore reminds us.
"They remain immortal, immaterial and everywhere, like all Divine
things." 

On this fateful night in 2008, Satoshi let the genie out of the bottle.
We went from a world where digital cash was just an idea to a world
where Bitcoin exists. Not only is the idea here to stay, but with every
passing block, Bitcoin reminds us that this idea is now a reality. As we
shall see, this new reality is more powerful than one might think at
first. It is powerful because it will usher in a new economic paradigm.
It is powerful because the time is ripe for it. It is powerful because
it can't be stopped. As Victor Hugo reminds us: nothing is as powerful
as an idea whose time has come. Bitcoin is here to stay; and Bitcoin's
time is now.

## An Idea Whose Time Has Come

> One withstands the invasion of armies; one does not withstand the
> invasion of ideas.
>
> <cite>Victor Hugo</cite>

Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin did not come out of nowhere. The
idea of digital cash has a long and rich history. Most notably, a loose
collective known as the *cypherpunks* wrote at length about digital
anonymous cash, how such systems might be realized, and the societal
implications of strong cryptography in general. Hence the
name: *cypher*punks. [^cypherpunks]

[^cypherpunks]: The name cypherpunk is a playful combination of the words *cipher* (an algorithm that encrypts and/or decrypts a message) and *cyberpunk* (a science fiction subgenre spawned by the works of authors like Philip K. Dick, William Gibson, Ridley Scott, and many others).

After forming the group in 1992, Eric Hughes, Timothy C. May, and John
Gilmore created the cypherpunk mailing list to discuss and share their
ideas around cryptography, remailers, anonymity, digital cash, and
"other interesting things" with a wider group of people. Many years
later, a cypherpunk by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto chose to publish the
Bitcoin whitepaper on a similar mailing list: the cryptography mailing
list.

As is apparent by studying their writings, the cypherpunks cared a great
deal about the idea of digital cash. In 1993, Eric Hughes discussed the
idea of digital cash, its relation to privacy, and its importance for a
free society in *A Cypherpunk's Manifesto*: "Since we desire privacy,
we must ensure that each party to a transaction have knowledge only of
that which is directly necessary for that transaction. Since any
information can be spoken of, we must ensure that we reveal as little as
possible. In most cases personal identity is not salient. When I
purchase a magazine at a store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no
need to know who I am."

The idea of digital cash (or electronic cash, as Satoshi chose to call
it in the Bitcoin whitepaper) is to have something in the digital realm
which behaves as cash does in the real world. No identity or sign-up
required, directly exchangeable for goods and services, and virtually
untraceable. 

Even the IANA[^IANA], a standards
organization responsible for defining HTTP status codes (among other
things), recognizes the idea of digital cash. We all know the infamous
404 error code, indicating that a resource can't be found. Few people
know that there is also a 402 error code, indicating that the resource
can't be accessed because it requires payment. However, since digital
cash did not exist at the time, the status code was "reserved for
future use" and isn't widely used as of today.

[^IANA]: Internet Assigned Numbers Authority

The cypherpunks focused mainly on the privacy aspect of digital cash.
Monetary and economic aspects were secondary. They realized that privacy
is absolutely paramount for a free and open society. After all, the
opposite - complete surveillance - can only lead to oppression and
stagnation, since new and controversial ideas won't be allowed to
flourish. No matter what freedoms you think you have, in the end,
surveillance renders all other freedoms useless.

> Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction
> systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An
> anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system. An
> anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when
> desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.

> <cite>Eric Hughes, [A Cypherpunk's Manifesto](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/cypherpunk-manifesto.txt)</cite>

While Bitcoin is a breakthrough in many ways, all the *technical* parts
that make it work did exist already: 

-   Public-key cryptography
-   Peer-to-peer networks
-   Digital signatures
-   Cryptographic hash functions
-   Cryptographic time stamps
-   Hash chains
-   Proof-of-work

We will explore all these concepts in more detail at later points in the
book.

Satoshi did not invent any clever new algorithm or cryptographic
primitive. Instead, he found a way to combine existing technologies in
an ingenious way, using economic incentives and game theory to bootstrap
and secure the system.

The cypherpunks were well aware that even if the base technology exists
in theory, some things simply need time to develop. In 1992, Timothy May
wrote in *The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto*: "The technology for this
\[\...\] has existed in theory for the past decade. \[\...\] But only
recently have computer networks and personal computers attained
sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next
ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas
economically feasible and essentially unstoppable."[^ca-manifesto]

[^ca-manifesto]: Timothy C. May, [The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/crypto/cypherpunks/may-crypto-manifesto.html)

While I do believe that Bitcoin (the network) is essentially unstoppable
already, Bitcoin the *idea* is truly unstoppable. After all, as Alan
Moore put it so succinctly, ideas are bulletproof. 

In the first decade of its existence, Bitcoin went from idea to
implementation to proof-of-concept to niche monetary asset. In the next
decade, it will probably become a force on its own, transcending
boundaries and transforming our understanding of money and value in the
process. The idea, however, wasn't conceived at Bitcoin's birth: it
was conceived by thinkers and tinkerers of the electronic age, multiple
decades before Satoshi Nakamoto entered the scene.

> <cite>Satoshi Nakamoto</cite>

Bitcoin's pre-history is as long as it is fascinating. Satoshi was able
to build upon various technologies and protocols, some of which go back
50 years and more. While 50 years might be a long time in technology,
the art of cryptography is way more ancient than that, dating back as
far as [1900 BC](https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/1976023).

It's hard to say what the most important building blocks were, but the
most fundamental ones are probably digital signatures[^dh1976] (Diffie and
Hellman, 1976) and public-key cryptography[^rsa1978] (Rivest, Shamir,
Adleman, 1978). Without these ideas, Bitcoin couldn't exist.

Various digital cash systems have been developed before Bitcoin. All of
them failed eventually, and all for similar reasons. The following are
particularly interesting in the context of Bitcoin:

1.  *Ecash* by David Chaum (1982)
2.  *E-gold* by Douglas Jackson and Barry Downey (1996)
3.  *hashcash* by Adam Back (1997)
4.  *bit gold* by Nick Szabo (1998)
5.  *b-money* by Wei Dai (1998)
6.  *RPOW - Reusable Proofs of Work* by Hal Finney (2004)

Let's take a closer look at these systems, see what they brought to the
table, and explore why they failed.

### Ecash (David Chaum, 1982)

Ecash utilized digital signatures to prove ownership, an idea that is
still used in Bitcoin today. Proposed by David Chaum in 1982, it was
later implemented by his company and operational for three years before
the firm went bankrupt in 1998. Chaum is still active as a
cryptographer. He pioneered many cryptographic techniques and pushed the
development of privacy-preserving technologies forward. One of the
privacy-enhancing transaction techniques in Bitcoin, the Chaumian
CoinJoin, is named in his honor. While Ecash was cryptographically and
technologically interesting, it wasn't a monetary innovation and
ultimately failed because it was operated by a centralized
entity: *DigiCash Inc.*, the company founded by Chaum.

### E-gold (Douglas Jackson and Barry Downey, 1996)

E-gold wasn't particularly ground-breaking cryptographically, but it
was one of the first digital currencies that gained traction. Although
others existed before it (OS-Gold, Standard Reserve, INTGold), e-gold is
considered to be the first successful digital currency that became
popular enough to have some merchant adoption. At its height, e-gold had
five million users and processed value transfers in the order of \$2
billion. Besides the e-gold tokens backed by gold, other precious
e-metals could be acquired: e-silver, e-platinum, and e-palladium. The
demise of e-cash, again, was that it was a centralized service run by a
company: *Gold & Silver Reserve Inc*. The U.S. government filed a
lawsuit claiming that the company was running an unlicensed money
transmitting business. In the end, the e-cash project failed because it
was operated by a company that could be shut down.

### Hashcash (Adam Back, 1997)

Originally proposed in 1997, and more formally published as [*Hashcash -
A Denial of Service
Counter-Measure*](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf) in 2002, Hashcash is one
of the essential ideas that made Bitcoin possible. While other
researchers had the idea of *Pricing via Processing*[^DwNa93] before Adam Back
(Dwork and Naor, 1992), his paper was referenced by Satoshi in the Bitcoin
whitepaper and led to what is known as Bitcoin's proof-of-work today. As far as
I can tell, the term proof-of-work was first introduced in the Hashcash
paper.[^hashcash-quote]

[^hashcash-quote]: "The hashcash CPU cost-function computes a token which can be used as a proof-of-work." [http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf)

[^DwNa93]: Dwork and Naor, 1992, *Pricing via Processing* ([PDF][DwNa93-pdf])
[DwNa93-pdf]: https://web.cs.dal.ca/~abrodsky/7301/readings/DwNa93.pdf

Hal Finney, one of the legends of the early Bitcoin days, beautifully and
succinctly described hashcash as follows: "Hashcash is a textual string in a
particular format which has a special property: when run through the SHA-1 hash
algorithm the result has the first N of its initial bits equal to zero, where N
is typically around 20-30. The terminology used for hashcash describes the
number of leading zero bits as the size of its 'collision'. Because of SHA-1's
properties, the only way to find a string with a large collision size is by
exhaustive search: trying one variation after another, until you get
lucky."[^rpow-theory]

[^rpow-theory]: Hal Finney, [RPOW Theory][rpow-theory]
[rpow-theory]: https://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/theory.html

For example, the SHA1 hash of the hashcash string 

```
1:20:040806:foo::65f460d0726f420d:13a6b8
```

produces a string with five leading zeros: [^hashcash-tools]

```
00000f91d51a9c213f9b7420c35c62b5e818c23e
```

[^hashcash-tools]: You can try this yourself using various online tools (e.g. [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sha1+hash+1%3A20%3A040806%3Afoo%3A%3A65f460d0726f420d%3A13a6b8)) or by typing the following into a command line: `echo -n 1:20:040806:foo::65f460d0726f420d:13a6b8 | sha1sum`

The leading number of zeros in a hashed hashcash string indicates how
valuable the hashcash string is. Because there is no other way than
brute force, the number of zeros is directly correlated with the cost of
production, which, in the digital realm, is the cost of computation.

In essence, hashcash utilizes the fact that computation cycles cost time and
real-world resources. Back proposed that introducing the electronic equivalent
of a postage stamp via hashcash could be its main use case. While fighting
e-mail spam seemed to be on the top of his mind, he also proposed that
it could be used as digital cash, going as far as sketching out
a [migration path](http://www.cypherspace.org/hashcash/) that could lead
to its integration in Chaum's ecash. While Bitcoin's
proof-of-work algorithm differs slightly from Hashcash's (using
double-SHA256 instead of SHA1, for example) - the idea remains the same:
computing a hash can't be done without flipping bits, which in turn
can't be done without expending time and energy. Hashcash exploits the
peculiar property of our universe that any computation, i.e. any change
of a system, requires energy. In other words: you can't cheat physics.
Computation will never be free. 

The genius of Hashcash was finding and describing computational
functions where computation is expensive but verification is
inexpensive. You can think of hashcash puzzles like solving Sudokus or
Rubik's Cubes: hard to solve, easy to check. While various Hashcash
implementations were used to prevent spam, the concept wasn't widely
applied to currencies before Satoshi used it in Bitcoin.

### Bit gold (Nick Szabo, 1998)

Building upon the work of Adam Back and Hal Finney, "bit gold" can be
described as a direct predecessor to "bit coin."[^bit-coin] While the system was never
implemented, the way Szabo envisioned it to work in theory is remarkably
close to the way Bitcoin works in actuality.

[^bit-coin]: In some of his very early writings, e.g. this [README](https://github.com/kyuupichan/bitcoin-0.01) file, Satoshi wrote Bitcoin as "BitCoin", indicating that it was meant to be understood as two separate words.

The purpose of bit gold, as the name implies, was to create a digital
monetary good independent from any central authority, which in turn can
be used as a store of value - just like gold in the physical world.
Szabo writes: "The objective, which I argued for vigorously, was to
create a long term store of value independent of any central authority,
yet far more secure than traditional gold." [^szabo-whitepaper]

[^szabo-whitepaper]: From the bit gold [early incomplete whitepaper](https://web.archive.org/web/20140406003811/http://szabo.best.vwh.net/bitgold.html) in which Szabo introduces the concept of **unforgeable costly** assets, linking the scarcity of certain goods to the costliness of their creation.

> Precious metals and
> collectibles[^szabo-metals] have an
> unforgeable scarcity due to the costliness of their creation. \[\...\]
> Thus, it would be very nice if there were a protocol whereby
> unforgeably costly bits could be created online with minimal
> dependence on trusted third parties, and then securely stored,
> transferred, and assayed with similar minimal trust.
>
> <cite>[Nick Szabo](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/)</cite>

[^szabo-metals]: [https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/)

One point that Szabo makes repeatedly is that physical gold has various
problems and is quite insecure when compared to solutions rooted in
cryptography. Storage, for example, is only as secure as the doors and
walls that protect it. And in the end, someone can always break in and
take it. The same goes for transportation. You can't send it securely
without extraordinary effort - and no matter your effort, someone could
always intercept it. Even validation is problematic, as an abundance of
"gold" bars made predominantly of lead or tungsten attest. Over time,
these insufficiencies of gold inevitably lead to centralization in
vaults and banks, which comes with its own set of problems.

> avoiding the insecurity of gold which has plagued civilization for
> millenia.
>
> <cite>[Nick Szabo](https://web.archive.org/web/20140406003811/http://szabo.best.vwh.net/bitgold.html)</cite>

The intended purpose of bit gold isn't the only thing that will be
familiar to bitcoiners today. The way the system was supposed to work
will be familiar as well. Granted, there are some crucial differences,
but the basic idea is eerily similar.

The following seven steps are taken directly from the bit gold paper and
outline how the system would operate:

1.  A public string of bits, the "challenge string," is created (see
    step 5).
2.  Alice on her computer generates the proof of work string from the
    challenge bits using a benchmark function.
3.  The proof of work is securely timestamped. This should work in a
    distributed fashion, with several different timestamp services so
    that no particular timestamp service need be substantially relied
    on.
4.  Alice adds the challenge string and the timestamped proof-of-work
    string to a distributed property title registry for bit gold. Here,
    too, no single server is substantially relied on to properly operate
    the registry.
5.  The last-created string of bit gold provides the challenge bits for
    the next-created string.
6.  To verify that Alice is the owner of a particular string of bit
    gold, Bob checks the unforgeable chain of title in the bit gold
    title registry.
7.  To assay the value of a string of bit gold, Bob checks and verifies
    the challenge bits, the proof of work string, and the timestamp.

There are two crucial differences between Szabo's approach and Bitcoin.
The first is that bit gold requires two separate registries: one for
recording timestamps (to note when the bit gold was created), and one
for recording property titles (to see who is owning the bit gold). The
second is that bit gold is supposed to rely on benchmark functions (as
opposed to **one-way functions**) to generate a proof of work.
Benchmark functions are functions proposed by Szabo that are
computationally stable, i.e. a set of functions that maintain a similar
degree of difficulty among all miners. He put considerable effort into
defining
and exploring these functions, trying to formulate mathematical proofs
that every computation will take at least a certain amount of time no
matter what computer architecture is used.[^intrapoly] However, since computers get
faster all the time, he remarked that finding such a function will be
difficult: "A potential big problem remains: \[\...\] The world lacks a
cryptanalytically stable problem."

[^intrapoly]: See his writings on [Intrapolynomial Cryptography](https://web.archive.org/web/20160717145748/http://szabo.best.vwh.net/intrapoly.html)

The lack of a stable benchmark function leads to a multitude of
problems: older "coins" created by users would have a different
costliness than newer ones since computers get faster as technology
progresses. Thus, two different coins - or strings of bit gold, as Szabo
called them - would not have the same value. If Moore's Law is any
indication, a coin that is two years older than another one might be
considered twice as valuable because the doubling of processing power
made minting the newer one twice as easy. Another problem is that - if
bit gold became valuable enough - computational breakthroughs might be
kept secret by those who made them, so valid strings of bit gold can be
amassed and sold on the market at a premium. This would exacerbate the
inflation problem, which is another problem that Szabo identified but
didn't solve.

In addition, Szabo correctly identified the issues of previous
approaches such as Hashcash and MicroMint[^micromint]: (1) their value was dependent
on a central authority, (2) the hash functions they use are
cryptographically vulnerable, i.e. they lack cryptanalytical stability.
As described above, the later problem is still present in bit gold.

[^micromint]: [MicroMint](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/RivestShamir-mpay.pdf) was one of two micropayment schemes proposed by Ronald L. Rivest and Adi Shamir (the R and S in RSA). The second scheme was called [PayWord](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/RivestShamir-mpay.pdf). Both focused on efficient payments of very small amounts, extending previous works such as [Millicent](http://www.cdk5.net/security/Ed3/Millicent.pdf) by Glassman et al. Again the idea is to use public-key cryptography and hashes in a clever way to produce coins: "A coin is a bit-string whose validity can be easily checked by anyone, but which is hard to produce.

### b-money (Wei Dai, 1998)

Like Szabo's bit gold, Wei Dai's b-money was never implemented. It
remained a theoretical proposal of how a monetary protocol could work.
While Bitcoin is a working implementation of the vision that b-money
outlines, it seems that Satoshi was unaware of b-money while coming up
with the core design of Bitcoin. As Wei Dai wrote [in a
response](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ijr8rsyvJci2edxot/making-money-with-bitcoin#hbEu9ue9eymNzaF2J) to
a LessWrong article: "my understanding is that the creator of Bitcoin
\[\...\] didn't even read my article before reinventing the idea
himself. He learned about it afterward and credited me in his paper. So
my connection with the project is quite limited." In 2013, Adam
Back [commented on
this](https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/bitcointalk.org/04fae2d16e18c40dafc07e98795313c10e6865ae.html#msg1873483),
mentioning that he introduced Satoshi to Wei Dai's b-money after
Satoshi reached out to him.

In his proposal, Dai is very outspoken regarding the motivation of his
system. Citing Tim May's ideas around crypto-anarchy, he writes that
"in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but
permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It's a community
where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible,
and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to
their true names or physical locations."

Dai goes on to describe a system where every participant maintains a
separate database of how much money belongs to each user. Users are
identified by pseudonyms (public keys), monetary units are created in
relation to computational effort, money is transferred by signing
messages, and contracts are executed by the protocol automatically.
Describing - in spirit, but not in detail - how Bitcoin operates today.

He outlines five things that are necessary for such a system to
function:

1.  The creation of money
2.  The transfer of money
3.  The effecting of contracts
4.  The conclusion of contracts
5.  The enforcement of contracts

While b-money solves many of the problems that are inherent to
electronic money, the problem described by Szabo in bit gold remains.
Dai mentions this in his proposal as follows: "One of the more
problematic parts in the b-money protocol is money creation. This part
of the protocol requires that all of the account keepers decide and
agree on the cost of particular computations. Unfortunately because
computing technology tends to advance rapidly and not always publicly,
this information may be unavailable, inaccurate, or outdated, all of
which would cause serious problems for the protocol."

Dai proposes a solution to this problem by describing a sub-protocol
that is solely responsible for money creation. Participants would
periodically agree upon how much money should be created, collectively
working together in a market-driven cycle that consists of four steps:
planning, bidding, computation, and creation. Since b-money was never
implemented in the form proposed by Dai, it is unclear whether this
elaborate money-creation scheme would have worked as intended.

### RPOW - Reusable Proofs of Work (Hal Finney, 2004)

As the name suggests, Hal Finney found a way to make the proof-of-work
tokens from Adam Back's hashcash *reusable*. 

Here is how it works, paraphrasing the original announcement by Hal
Finney himself: The system receives hashcash as a proof-of-work (POW)
token, and in exchange creates RSA-signed tokens which are called
reusable proof-of-work (RPOW) tokens. RPOWs can then be transferred from
person to person and exchanged for new RPOWs at each step. Each RPOW
token can only be used once but since it gives birth to a new one, it is
as though the same token can be handed from person to person.

{% include image.html name="rpow.png" caption="Ownership in RPOW is transferred via trust-minimized servers." %}

In essence, a user can create RPOW tokens via the RPOW client software,
which takes a proof-of-work string as generated by the Hashcash software
invented by Adam Back. This string is signed by the user's private key
and subsequently registered by an RPOW server, recording that this token
is belonging to the user's public key. The user can then pass that
token on to someone else by signing a "transfer order" to another
user's public key. The server then duly registers the token as
belonging to the corresponding private key.

As is apparent by studying his writings, Hal Finney was inspired and
building upon work by Nick Szabo, most notably his ideas around "bit
gold" and digital collectibles. Discussing possible applications of
RPOW, Hal
writes:
"Security researcher Nick Szabo has coined the term bit gold for
information objects which are provably costly to create. He suggests
that these could even serve as the foundation for a sort of payment
system, playing the role in the informational world of gold in the
physical world. RPOW would facilitate the use of POW tokens as a form of
bit gold by allowing the tokens to be passed and exchanged from person
to person."[^rpow]

[^rpow]: [https://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/index.html](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/index.html) - See also [Shelling Out: The Origins of Money](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/)

Hal's implementation was a practical solution to a problem inherent in
proof-of-work tokens, namely that the POW tokens themselves don't make
very good money. POW tokens are just hashes - bits of information - that
can be double-spent. With the concept of RPOW servers, Hal introduced
central, but trust-minimized authorities that can cryptographically
determine a chain of ownership. This allows proof-of-work tokens to be
re-used, albeit in a limited, sequential way.

While the RPOW architecture is hierarchical, i.e. its clients rely on
specialized servers, the trust users need to have in an RPOW server is
minimized. This is possible because the RPOW server software is run on
an IBM 4758 secure cryptographic coprocessor, a high-security
tamper-resistant PCI board that cryptographically ensures that the
software running on the server is the software that was published and
audited. This makes any RPOW server a system whose security properties
can be analyzed and evaluated by anyone. In other words, an RPOW server
is a *transparent server*, which makes the RPOW system as a whole
trust-minimized. Everyone knows the code that makes the system work, as
well as the rules that are in place. 

> We know the source code. We know the rules.
>
> <cite>[Hal Finney](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/slides/slide009.html)</cite>

So, what exactly are the rules of the RPOW system? According to its inventor,
they are as follows:[^rpow-slides]

[^rpow-slides]: [https://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/slides/slide010.html](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/slides/slide010.html)

-   No inflation
-   No back doors
-   Privacy protection

The "no inflation" rule has to be understood in terms of the
constraints set up by the system itself, i.e. that any RPOW server will
only create RPOW tokens equal in value to incoming POW and RPOW tokens.
Since users can create new proof-of-work tokens via Adam Back's
hashcash, inflation in terms of new supply coming into the system can
and will always happen.

"To enforce the no-inflation rule, the RPOW server must make sure that
no POW or RPOW can be used more than once as part of an exchange. Each
one is created, and then exchanged at the server for a new RPOW, and
after that, the old one can never be used again. The RPOW server
enforces this rule primarily by keeping a record of all of the RPOWs and
POWs that it has seen in the past. Whenever one is offered for exchange,
the RPOW server compares it against this database of previously-seen
RPOWs. If it is on the list, this is an attempt to reuse the POW or
RPOW, and the exchange request is rejected. If the POW or RPOW is not on
the list, it is added to the list, and then the RPOW server will sign
the bignum value supplied as part of the exchange, creating a new
RPOW."

The "no back doors" rule refers to the transparency of the system.
Everyone can inspect how it works at all times, there are no hidden
parts.

The "privacy protection" rule is an interesting one. Hal wrote at
length about how privacy is an inherently desirable feature, advocating
the use of Tor[^tor] to connect to the RPOW servers and
discussing both attack vectors (linkage attacks) and improvements such
as the use of blind signatures. In his writings, he goes on to point out
two additional things: (1) the "owner is the enemy", and (2) the
"programmer is the enemy", reminding us that any system that
facilitates the trust-minimized exchange of money needs to be set up and
operate under an adversarial mindset.

Next to hashcash, RPOW was one of the systems that was actually
implemented. However, probably because of the effort required to run
RPOW servers, as well as a lack of incentives to do so, Finney's
reusable proof-of-work tokens never gained traction and the project was
eventually discontinued.

## Satoshi's Breakthrough

On February 11, 2009, Satoshi posted an announcement to the *P2P
Foundation* forums. The P2P Foundation studies the impact of
peer-to-peer technology and thought on society, describing itself as
"The Foundation for Peer to Peer Alternatives." Thus, it was a very
fitting place to announce the invention of a peer-to-peer money like
Bitcoin.

In his announcement, Satoshi describes Bitcoin as a "P2P e-cash
system" that has "no central server or trusted parties" because
"everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust."

{% include image.html name="announcement.png" caption="Satoshi's original announcement of Bitcoin" %}

He identifies multiple problems with our current monetary system and the
conventional currencies that are native to it:

-   trust in third parties
-   currency debasement by central banks
-   credit bubbles
-   fractional reserve banking
-   privacy
-   lack of micropayments due to overhead costs
-   middlemen

Just by glancing at this list, Bitcoin's enormously ambitious scope
becomes apparent. Satoshi didn't set out to solve one problem. He set
out to solve many problems at once. Amazingly, he got so many things
right from the start that he was actually able to solve most of them.
All he had to do was convince others that his solution actually worked.

Knowing his audience, he goes on to point out how similar trust-related
issues were solved in the world of computer systems in general, i.e. how
strong cryptography did away with having to trust system administrators
with your data. Once your files are encrypted, you do not need to trust
whoever has access to these files, since they would need your password
to decrypt them. In other words: we moved from trusting humans to
trusting mathematics. This is especially relevant in a peer-to-peer
setting, because thanks to strong cryptography, you can exchange
confidential data with others - including your future self - without
having to rely on any middlemen.

To better understand Satoshi's breakthrough, let's recap what was
possible before and where other systems fell short. The following is
what was possible before Bitcoin:

-   Account creation via public-key cryptography
-   Unforgeable costly tokens via proof-of-work
-   Proving ownership via digital signatures
-   Passing on proof-of-work tokens via signature chains

And here is what wasn't possible:

-   Preventing double-spending without a trusted third party
-   Limiting supply without a trusted third party

To Satoshi, it was obvious that any centrally controlled system will get
shut down by governments. Thus, the system he wanted to build had one
goal above all others: decentralization.

> <cite>[Satoshi Nakamoto](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/4/)</cite>

The above quote beautifully encapsulates why decentralization is so
important: there are no heads to cut off, no CEOs to arrest, no leaders
to blackmail or pressure, no single group of people to subpoena, no
servers to shut down. In other words: decentralization
maximizes [survival][life].

A central point in any system makes it vulnerable and thus prone to
attack. A sufficiently motivated attacker will find and exploit these
points of failure. And when it comes to money, the state has all the
motivation in the world to shut down a competing system. This - and only
this - is why Bitcoin's design is so intricate and complicated. Its
incentive-driven architecture favors one thing above all else: survival.
Because you would have to destroy all parts of it simultaneously, a
radically decentralized system is extremely resilient to any kind of
disruption.

While previous attempts - especially bit gold, b-money, and RPOW - were
quite close to Bitcoin's eventual design, all systems had at least one
of the following flaws:

-   Central ownership registry required to prevent double-spending
-   Coin value dependent on a central authority
-   Controlled issuance only possible through a centralized body
-   Unstable proof-of-work function (computationally speaking)

Except for the last point, all of these flaws are flaws because they
require a centralized body, exposing a head that could be cut off by
governments. Satoshi's genius was the removal of all heads, including
his own.

Again, the essential problem for money in the digital realm boils down to two
things: **scarcity**, and **double-spending**. While obviously related - you
can't have digital scarcity without solving the problem of double-spending -
they aren't exactly the same thing. Satoshi solved both of these problems at
once, by using a peer-to-peer network as a non-central ledger, using a global
timechain to synchronize state, and dynamically adjusting the puzzle difficulty
to achieve cryptanalytical stability - making a predictable issuance possible.

Further, he combined the process of issuance, transfer, and
verification, removing the need for any trusted third party. The genius
of Bitcoin is that every node can verify everything for itself at all
times. To paraphrase Hal Finney: "You know the source code. You know
the rules."

Satoshi was able to decentralize all the functions of Wei
Dai's *b-money* (creation and transfer of money; effecting, conclusion,
and enforcement of contracts) while also solving the problems of
Szabo's "*bit gold*" (coin value dependent on a central authority;
hash functions lack cryptanalytical stability). He did it by taking Hal
Finney's idea of reusable proof-of-work tokens to the next level,
creating a digital asset that is both fungible and has a high
unforgeable costliness. Like RPOW before it, the resulting system has no
inflation, no back doors, and protects the privacy of its users.

It is helpful to look at the different functions of a financial- or
banking-type system to understand why Bitcoin operates in the way it
does. In essence, such a system needs to be able to do the following:

-   **Account Creation:** users need to be able to create accounts and
    authenticate themselves.
-   **Record Ownership:** the system needs to be able to record who owns
    what.
-   **Prove Ownership:** some sort of certification is required to
    confirm that a user actually owns the asset, so the user can prove
    this fact to himself and others.
-   **Transfer Ownership:** users need to be able to transfer ownership
    of assets.
-   **Security:** the system needs to make sure that ownership records,
    the computer network, and user data are safe.

In addition, when it comes to monetary systems, it is desirable to have
the following:

-   **Scarcity:** the money should be hard to produce, i.e. it should
    have unforgeable costliness as described by Nick Szabo.
-   **Controlled Issuance:** new monetary units should be issued evenly
    and over a long period of time, allowing for organic distribution
    among participants.
-   **Auditability:** independent third parties should be able to audit
    the supply (as well as the security of the system).

Satoshi found a way to decentralize all of the functions listed above,
using a mix of peer-to-peer technology, cryptography, probabilities,
game theory, physics, and economic incentives. In other words: thanks to
the universality of the laws of mathematics and physics, Satoshi was
able to build a non-local system.

To be more concrete, let's have a closer look at these features and how
Bitcoin manages to implement them in a decentralized way:

-   **Account Creation:** Thanks to public-key cryptography, user
    account creation can be completely decentralized. Anyone, at any
    time, can create one or multiple keypairs to interact with the
    Bitcoin system. There are no sign-up forms, no central authorities
    to approve or deny applications, no servers in charge of logins. In
    essence, creating an account in Bitcoin is just a matter of
    generating a large random number. You can even flip a coin a couple
    of times, or roll a pair of dice, as long as you know what you're
    doing (and your dice and coin flips are fair).
-   **Record Ownership:** In Bitcoin, every full node has a
    copy of the ownership records. This radical approach is a simple way
    to eliminate a centralized registry and optimize for survival: You
    can't shut down the registry if everyone is the registry.
-   **Prove Ownership:** Like other systems before it, Bitcoin uses
    cryptographic signatures to prove ownership. If you have the private
    key to sign a message, you can prove that the related public key as
    well as the assets linked to this public key belong to you. No
    central authority that hands out ownership certificates required.
-   **Transfer Ownership:** Ownership is transferred via a chain of
    signatures, just like in Hal Finney's RPOW system. Unlike in RPOW,
    no central servers are required, since the chain of ownership is
    hosted (and validated) by every full node.
-   **Security:** Bitcoin is secured in many different ways, all of
    which rely on cryptography in one form or another, which in turn
    relies on the power of ridiculously large numbers. The probability
    that someone will guess your private key or one of your addresses is
    virtually zero, as is the probability that someone will find the
    hash of a valid block without doing the necessary brute-force work.
    The combination of strong cryptography and the cumulative energy
    expended by miners secures both the assets of users, as well as the
    integrity of the network. The system itself has never been hacked,
    making it the most secure computer network of all time. Bitcoin can
    only be meaningfully attacked at the edges, i.e. private keys can be
    stolen from individual users or custodians.
-   **Scarcity:** Because Bitcoin is the first practical, non-central
    solution to the double-spend problem, it made digital scarcity
    possible for the first time. Satoshi could have chosen any terminal
    inflation rate, but he chose a terminal inflation rate
    of [zero](https://breedlove22.medium.com/the-number-zero-and-bitcoin-4c193336db5b).
    The result: 21 million bitcoin, nothing more. What this means for
    Bitcoin and the world at large will be explored in Chapter 7.
-   **Controlled Issuance:** Because of Bitcoin's **difficulty
    adjustment**, controlled issuance is possible in a
    decentralized fashion. The difficulty adjustment is what solves the
    problem of cryptanalytic instability, as Satoshi points out in the
    whitepaper: "To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying
    interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is
    determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks
    per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases."
    During the network's reward era, which will end approximately in
    the year 2140, new bitcoins will enter the economy with every valid
    block, i.e. roughly every ten minutes. Bitcoin's supply was
    predetermined at its inception, and arguably, this is the most
    valuable property of Bitcoin. No other asset in existence has what
    Bitcoin has: an unchanging supply schedule that can not be argued
    with.

In short, mathematics allows for the decentralization of all the
essential functions of the system and the laws of thermodynamics allow
for strong security guarantees. Further, economic incentives and game
theory are the glue that keeps everything together.

Satoshi also realized that the only real-world asset that can be linked
to a computer system in a trustless manner is energy, nothing else.
Every other thing - no matter if it's gold, paper certificates, real
estate, or strawberries, re-introduces a trusted third party because of
the inherent disconnect between the digital and the physical world.
Someone has to make sure that the real-world assets and the digital
representation of these assets - in essence, a list of things - remains
up-to-date and in sync. This is what is known as the **oracle
problem**, and proof-of-work solves it in an ingenious,
roundabout way: by using energy, and thus physics, as the base truth.
One can also think of the oracle problem as a variant of the GIGO
principle: Garbage In, Garbage Out. You have to trust whoever is keeping
the records that the records are correct. Phrased differently: you can
never be sure that the data at hand represents reality, except if the
reality is rooted in computation itself.

## A Most Timely Idea

As we can see by examining Bitcoin's pre-history, double-spending and
digital scarcity aren't easy problems to solve. Satoshi's breakthrough
was to find a way to solve both of these problems practically, not
academically. The first is solved by a globally
shared **timechain** that is kept in sync via a competitive lottery, the
second is solved by the **difficulty adjustment** as well as the **block
reward halving**. Bitcoin uses the best ideas of its predecessors
(digital signatures, reusable proof-of-work, peer-to-peer networks) and
combines them in an ingenious way to create something completely new: a
decentralized system without a single point of failure.

No single part of Bitcoin can be removed without destroying the whole. Without
the timechain, there wouldn't be a decentralized way to check for
double-spending. Without the block reward halving, the bitcoin supply would
expand indefinitely. Without the difficulty adjustment, the mining algorithm
wouldn't have cryptanalytic stability, making it trivial for miners to produce
bitcoin more quickly. Many cypherpunks dreamed of digital cash. Satoshi took
this idea further than anyone else before him, implementing a system that is
virtually unstoppable. No matter what happens in the coming decades, the cat is
out of the bag, and everyone will have to adjust to a world in which Bitcoin
exists.

**Bitcoin is an idea** whose time has come.
As more and more people, companies, and even nation-states move towards a
Bitcoin Standard, the unstoppable [gravity] of Satoshi's idea becomes ever more
apparent.
By implementing his idea, he proved that a practical solution to the problems
that plagued digital money for decades --- *double-spending* and *digital
scarcity* --- is possible. Releasing his software into the wild set in motion a
multi-decade process that is driven by an extremely powerful incentive
structure. An unstoppable idea, embodied in code. It is this incentive structure
that drives Bitcoin's survival. And with every passing day that Bitcoin refuses
to die, humanity is one step closer to freeing money from the capture of the
state. It will take some time for the world to come to grips with this most
powerful idea. Amusingly, time is also the reason why Bitcoin works in the first
place since the main insight Satoshi had is how to keep the [time] in a
decentralized system. Many people thought that this problem was insoluble. Turns
out that all that was missing was the right idea.
