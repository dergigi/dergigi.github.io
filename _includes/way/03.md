Technology is a marvelous thing. We are so quick to accept things as
they stand, rarely taking the time to reflect on how magical these
modern miracles are in actuality. Much of what we take for granted today
would be indistinguishable from magic to anyone living just a couple of
generations ago. Take a smartphone, for example. A pocket-sized piece of
glass that can retrieve any piece of information at any time, talk to
you, understand you, recognize faces, read fingerprints, record audio
and video, and take high-resolution photographs. It is a flashlight, a
compass, a navigation system, a notebook, a calendar, a travel planner,
and a million other things. It can hold more books than the Great
Library of Alexandria and show you more movies than you could ever
watch, even if you had hundreds of lifetimes. And now, it can also hold
your money and be your bank.

As with all technology, you don't necessarily need to understand how
your smartphone works in order to use it. In the same vein, most people
have no idea how an internal combustion engine works, yet they drive
their car every day. They might have an approximate understanding - one
that is good enough to have some faith in the thing they are using - but
it will often remain just that: an approximate understanding. How
lacking our knowledge of the inner workings of anything truly is becomes
apparent as soon as that thing breaks down. Once the car refuses to
start, the computer refuses to boot, or the router refuses to connect,
our ignorance is laid bare. What is true for the marvels of the present
will also be true for the marvels of the future: you don't need to
understand how everything works to use it successfully.

The best way to become acquainted with technology (or magic, for that
matter) is to use it. There is no better way to learn how something
works - how it can be useful to you - than hands-on experience. What's
true for cars and smartphones is also true for Bitcoin. It is true for
most things in our world, even the most mundane. You probably don't
know every detail of how a lock works, but you know that failing to lock
your car or the door to your house might lead to disaster. Similarly,
you won't have to learn all the intricacies of public-key cryptography
and hashing functions to understand that mishandling your private keys
might lead to disaster as well.

### Modern Wizardry

> The good thing about bitcoin is that you know exactly the number ---

> <cite>Garry Kasparov</cite>

Bitcoin is a child of the internet. The whitepaper describing it wasn't
published in a scientific journal but freely on the internet. Its
software wasn't created by a gargantuan software company but by a
pseudonymous netizen. It wasn't sold to the public; it was released
online for free. Thus, it is quite fitting that Bitcoin's first viral
advertisement was not created by an ad agency but by an individual on
the internet. 

On February 18, 2013, *theymos* asked the Bitcoin community on Reddit if they
had any ideas for a site-internal Bitcoin ad. An hour later, *mavensbot*
submitted a glorious painting of an incredibly well-drawn and beautiful blue
wizard.

{% include image.html name="wizard.jpg" caption="The original Bitcoin Wizard"%}

One can only echo the words of *ManboobsTheClown*: "Perfect."

The wizard took on a life of his own, conjuring himself onto t-shirts,
socks, mugs, paintings, and other artwork. He was drawn and re-drawn
many times, and the largest miracle he performed was that his
description of Bitcoin stuck: *Magic Internet Money*.

Internet culture is weird, and arguably, Bitcoin culture is even
weirder. This is not particularly surprising since the early adopters of
any new system - be it a global communications network or magical
cryptographic money that will inevitably uproot the monetary structure
of this world - come from the fringes. Just like you had to be a little
bit of an oddball to be online in the early days, you had to be a
peculiar creature to be interested in Bitcoin in the first couple of
years.

While we have truly come a long way from the early days, Bitcoin still
is and will always be Magic Internet Money. It is magical, it is
internet-y, and it is money. Really good money.

### Satoshi Nakamoto: The First Bitcoin Wizard

> First rule of magic: Don't let anyone know your real name. Names

As we have seen in Chapter 1, Bitcoin has a long intellectual
pre-history. It didn't appear out of nowhere. Its creator, however,
did. Satoshi Nakamoto first popped on the scene with the announcement of
the Bitcoin whitepaper on October 31, 2008. While Satoshi had some
private correspondences with select people before that (most notably
Adam Back and Wei Dai), the night of Halloween 2008 was when he wrote
his first public email to the *Cryptography Mailing List*.

As he mentions in his writings, he had been working on the design of
Bitcoin for over 1.5 years, mulling over the [idea of electronic cash][idea]
(and what transaction types might come in handy) for many years before
that.

[idea]: {% post_url /bitcoin/2021-06-13-bitcoin-is-an-idea %}

While little is known about Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, many have
tried to reveal the identity of the person (or persons) behind Satoshi
Nakamoto. So far, all attempts were either horribly misguided, wildly
speculative, or both. To this day, all of them were inconclusive. 

Probably the most prominent example of such an outing attempt was made
by journalist Leah McGrath Goodman who identified Dorian Prentice
Satoshi Nakamoto as Bitcoin's creator. Dorian, a retired engineer who
was 64-years old at the time, denied having anything to do with Bitcoin,
mentioning that he only heard about it some weeks before the reporter
broke the news and turned his life upside-down. After the media hype
settled down, the Bitcoin community started to embrace Dorian as a
stand-in for the face of Satoshi Nakamoto, producing memes and artwork
in the process. The man became somewhat of a meme himself, and if the
identity of Satoshi remains a mystery, he might forever be the face of
Bitcoin's inventor.

{% include image.html name="dorian.jpg" caption="Portrait of Dorian Nakamoto by Trevor Jones" %}

Over the years, multiple people came forward claiming to be the creator
of Bitcoin. Ranging from the obscure to compulsive liars to the mentally
challenged, nobody was able to prove that he[^shetoshi] is Satoshi - a
claim that, thanks to public-key cryptography, would be as easy to prove
as signing a message with one of Satoshi's private keys.

[^shetoshi]: So far, no female was bold or stupid enough to make such a claim.

Alas, without cryptographic proof, all that remains are outrageous
claims and wild speculation. While some people are undoubtedly annoyed
that their curiosity in regards to Satoshi's identity isn't stilled, I
am not saddened by it. To the contrary. The fact that we do not know who
Satoshi Nakamoto is is a feature, not a bug. A leaderless system must
not have a leader. As Jimmy Song so succinctly remarked, "one of the
greatest things that Satoshi did was disappear."

Apart from his legacy that is Bitcoin, Satoshi left us with a collection
of comments and writings that accompanied the code. His many public
posts - as well as some private discussions he had with other
cryptographers and early adopters of Bitcoin - are still available
online. If you are interested in exploring the writings of Satoshi, the
following two resources are probably the most complete archives to date:
[*The Complete Satoshi*](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/), hosted by the
Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, and
[*The Book of Satoshi*](https://www.bookofsatoshi.com/) by Phil Champagne,
which includes explanations and historical context in addition to Satoshi's
writings. 

These writings allow us to sketch out a timeline of Satoshi's
activities, spanning from his sudden appearance in 2008 to his
disappearance in 2010. The following is such a timeline along with
important events in Bitcoin's early history:

So it came to be that after a little over two years, on December 12,
2010, Satoshi disappeared. Some of his final remarks were that "the
project is in good hands" and that he had "moved on to other things."
A short time before he vanished, two of the most prominent projects of
Bitcoin's early history were launched: Mt. Gox and Silk Road. Both have
magical origins: one used to deal with magic cards, the other with magic
mushrooms.

### Magic Cards: The Mt.Gox Era

*Magic: The Gathering* is a popular card game played by millions of
people around the world. Its playing cards are collectibles: some are
rare and expensive (and oftentimes more powerful), others are relatively
abundant and cheap. Each round of the game represents a battle between
two or more wizards (the players) casting spells and summoning creatures
(the cards). The original card game was released in 1993 by Wizards of
the Coast, gaining in popularity from 2008 to 2016. Several expansion
packs and editions were introduced over the years, including new cards,
new game mechanics, and visual redesigns. At its height, the game was
played by more than 20 million people, and more than 20 *billion* cards
have been printed, according to the company. In 2002, the game moved to
cyberspace with the introduction of *Magic: The Gathering Online* - the
official online version of the card game.

It was this version that led Jed McCaleb to launch Mt. Gox, the "Magic:
The Gathering Online eXchange." What used to be a platform for *Magic:
The Gathering* enthusiasts - a place which allowed you to trade these
playing cards like stocks - would turn out to be the catalyst for one of
the darkest chapters in Bitcoin's short history.

McCaleb launched the site in 2007, years before Bitcoin was even a
thing. The online marketplace didn't really gain traction, and after a
couple of months, he decided to discontinue the card trading platform.
However, after reading about Bitcoin on Slashdot in 2010, he re-launched
the site. This time, the focus wasn't on trading Magic playing cards.
This time, the focus was on trading Magic Internet Money.

Being one of the only sites where you could buy bitcoin, Mt. Gox quickly
gained in popularity. By 2013 and into 2014, it was responsible for over
70% of all bitcoin transactions worldwide. After just three years, Mt.
Gox became the leading bitcoin exchange and the world's largest bitcoin
intermediary. And then everything went South.

The downfall of Mt. Gox would probably be worth a book on its own. In
short, due to negligence, incompetence, mismanagement, and probably more
than a little bit of malice, Mt. Gox "lost" 850,000 bitcoin, which
amounted to \$450 million and around 7% of the total supply at the time.
The company filed for bankruptcy at the end of February 2014. One month
later, Mt. Gox claimed to have found around 200,000 coins again,
bringing down the total amount missing to 650,000. Investigations
revealed that most of the funds were stolen slowly over time, starting
in late 2011. Today, ten years after the launch of the notorious bitcoin
exchange, investigations and legal processes are still ongoing. 

The silver lining to the Mt. Gox saga is that a lesson was learned. An
incredibly expensive lesson, and a lesson that needs to be repeated over
and over again, lest the history that is Mt. Gox will repeat itself:
your keys, your bitcoin. *Not your keys, not your bitcoin.*

### Magic Mushrooms: Silk Road

Probably the most notorious chapter of Bitcoin's early history is the
rise and fall of the *Silk Road*, an anonymous dark market that allowed
individuals to buy and sell goods online - independent of their legal
status. Launched by Ross Ulbricht in 2011, the Silk Road was a small
community of buyers, sellers, and users of recreational drugs.
Eventually, it became *the* place to buy drugs online. The eBay of
drugs, as some called it. Today, we would probably describe it as the
Amazon of drugs: a website where you could buy any substance from A to
Z, and just a few days later, whatever you bought shows up in the mail.

Ross started to dream of an unrestrictive online marketplace around the
same time that Satoshi worked on his ideas around Bitcoin. In line with
libertarian ideals, he wanted the Silk Road to be a place where you
could buy and sell any recreational substance, freely and directly. In
his opinion, the government should have no say what a person shall or
shall not put into their body. It should be the individual's choice.
Everyone should be allowed to decide for themselves. 

At first, he wasn't sure how to best realize this vision. Obviously,
such an endeavor would be immediately shut down by law enforcement. But
after a friend of his introduced him to Tor, a path to a technological
solution began to emerge. Tor offers the possibility to hide any website
or online service behind layers of obfuscation and encryption, which
effectively enables someone to run such a site privately and
anonymously. If nobody can figure out the location of the servers or the
identity of the people that run them, nobody can intervene. However, one
problem remained: payments. When Ross started thinking about
implementing such an anonymous online market, he wasn't yet aware of
any way to send payments anonymously. Electronic cash was the missing
ingredient of the soup that Mr. Ulbricht was cooking.

Bitcoin was the last piece of the puzzle that was required to turn the
idea of the Silk Road into reality. Once Ross discovered the magic of
the orange coin, he got busy. Now that he had all the tools, he was
determined to build the site. The only thing that was left to do was to
get his hands on a product that he could sell on his newly created
marketplace. His product of choice was psilocybin mushrooms, which he
grew himself in a small cabin off the grid. He was able to produce
several kilos of these psychoactive mushrooms, telling only his
girlfriend at the time about the whole operation. His plan was to work
on the code for the Silk Road on the side, building the virtual
marketplace while the first product was growing. He would announce the
launch of Silk Road in several internet forums once the site was live
- *BitcoinTalk* among others - interested people would figure out the
rest. His plan worked, and a few weeks after the harvest, Ross Ulbricht
became the first vendor on Silk Road, selling magic mushrooms in
exchange for magic internet money.

{% include image.html name="silkroad-mainpage.png" caption="The Silk Road"%}

What started as a website with magic mushrooms as its only listing
eventually grew into something that was larger than even the most
optimistic projections of its idealistic founder could have imagined. It
is estimated that the Silk Road's revenue exceeded 9.5 million bitcoin
during the duration of its existence, amounting to hundreds of millions
in US dollar terms. Some estimates go even as high as \$1.2 billion.
Other numbers are equally impressive: over one million transactions were
facilitated between almost one million registered users, and the site
listed tens of thousands of goods. Eventually, Ross Ulbricht, aka *Dread
Pirate Roberts*, was caught and subsequently arrested, and the Silk Road
was shut down.[^kingpin]

[^kingpin]: If you are interested in the details of this particular chapter of Bitcoin's history, I would recommend *Silk Road* by Eileen Ormsby and *American Kingpin* by Nick Bilton, two great books on the topic.

The story of Ross Ulbricht, his arrest, and the rise and fall of the
Silk Road is as fascinating as it is captivating. It is a story of a
young, ambitious, and highly intelligent guy that eventually became DPR:
dreaded pirate and captain of the largest virtual drug ship the world
has ever seen. A tale of idealism, love, multiple identities, corrupt
FBI agents, hitmen, moral conundrums, betrayal, friendship, fake
murders, real theft, and the blurry lines between good and evil. It is a
story that will forever be interwoven with the early days of bitcoin.
For many, the Silk Road was a gateway drug to the orange pill: the first
contact with Magic Internet Money.

Ross is now serving a double life sentence plus 40 years without the
possibility of parole, essentially for launching a website. While the
whole story is nuanced and complicated, this is undoubtedly an
exceedingly harsh penalty for committing non-violent crimes, especially
since details of how the case was handled and evidence was obtained are
questionable.[^freeross]

[^freeross]: [Free Ross](https://freeross.org/) is a petition that was launched to protest this grossly excessive sentence and fight for Ross Ulbricht's clemency.  

Of course, ideas can't be imprisoned. After the Silk Road was shut
down, other "dark" marketplaces popped up, many of which exist to this
day. Undoubtedly, dark and gray online markets will be with us for as
long as global communication networks and strong encryption exist. What
might be seen as atrocious by some is welcomed by others as a safer and
more convenient way to obtain recreational drugs and pharmaceuticals
that are either hard to obtain (because of price or the necessity for
prescriptions) or illegal in their jurisdiction. Whatever your opinion
of these matters might be, bitcoin, and the dark and gray markets it
enables, are here to stay.

Due to its persistence and a relentless rise in price, the public
perception of Bitcoin shifted from untraceable darknet money to
speculative asset over the years. For some people, myself included, the
perception shifted even further: from speculative asset to hard money
and savings technology. However, I think it's important to understand
the early history of Bitcoin, including its early uses, the motivation
behind them, and the reason why Bitcoin was chosen to solve the problems
these early adopters faced. 

How and why Bitcoin is used - as well as by whom - will undoubtedly keep
changing over time. But whether you use it to buy magic mushrooms or
not, Bitcoin will always remain Magic Internet Money.

### Magic: Teleportation, Shapeshifting, and Invisibility

It's hard to explain the magic of Bitcoin if you haven't experienced
it yourself. Receiving magic internet money for the first time is, well,
magical! Hell, even after all these years in the Bitcoin space, I'm
still enchanted. The fact that random people from the internet can
teleport value directly into my otherworldy purse is nothing short of
miraculous.

The fact that that these coins flow directly between you and me is
absolutely magical. No intermediaries, no trusted third parties, no
service to sign up to. Just you and me, communicating via a series of
tubes.

The implications of this are as profound as they are fascinating. How
does it work? Who is in charge? Where do these coins come from? Can I
make more? These and a million other questions will pop into your head
once you start to grasp the profundity of what just happened: Someone
gave you something of *value* just by sending you a *message*!

Satoshi was probably the first person that alluded to the magical
properties of Bitcoin. In one of his many forum posts, he wrote: "As a
thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but
with the following properties: boring grey in color, not a good
conductor of electricity, not particularly strong, but not ductile or
easily malleable either, not useful for any practical or ornamental
purpose, and one special, magical property: can be transported over a
communications channel."

Of course, bitcoin is this magical base metal that Satoshi alluded to.
The fact that it can be transported via *any* communications channel is
astounding. It implies that the internet is not a necessity for Bitcoin.
In theory, you could use pretty much anything to send (and store!) your
bitcoin. Currently, the internet is by far the best communication tool
we have. As of now, sending packets across the internet is Bitcoin's
preferred mode of communication. If you want to teleport some sats from
point A to point B, you would probably use the internet to do so.

Due to its lack of physicality, there is no limit to what shape your
bitcoin might have: text, QR codes, images, sound, artworks, emojis -
the only limiting factor is our imagination (more on that in Chapter
17). Whether we are talking about storage or the transmission of
transactions, Bitcoin can shapeshift into anything it needs to be. This
magical property is, in part, what makes Bitcoin so resilient to
censorship. Bitcoin transactions can be encoded into pretty much
anything, and - of course - they can be sent via end-to-end encrypted
communication channels, making them completely unrecognizable. How can
you censor something if you can't tell what you're looking at?

bitcoin in plain sight."%}

But shapeshifting and teleportation aren't Bitcoin's only tricks. If I
had to pick a favorite, I would probably pick bitcoin's magical ability
to disappear. And I don't mean the "send me all your bitcoin and I
will send you twice the amount back" kind of disappear, but the
plausible deniability kind. In essence, all you possess is a magic
spell: your *private key*, which holds the power to
unlock your bitcoin so it can be teleported someplace else. Most people
store this spell on a piece of paper (or a piece of steel, or a piece of
specialized hardware). However, you can - with some effort - learn this
spell by heart and move your bitcoin inside your brain, effectively
making them vanish. 

While this is a horrible idea if you suffer from amnesia, it could be
incredibly useful if you are forced to resort to such drastic measures.
Imagine all the people that had to flee their country at a moment's
notice, leaving all their valuable possessions behind. Now imagine if
they had a meaningful portion of their net worth in bitcoin and the
magic spell to unlock them in their head. They could cross the border
naked with their wealth intact. There would be nothing for the border
officers to find, and with a single "abracadabra," our naked
protagonists could restore their wealth once they arrived in a safe
place. Magical, isn't it?

### Internet: The Double-Spending Problem

All computers are copying machines. The internet itself, in essence, is
a gigantic copying machine. This, coincidentally, is also the reason why
money on the internet didn't exist until the invention of Bitcoin. 

If you move a file on your computer, it doesn't actually move as real
objects do in the real world. It is copied, and after the copy is
checked for errors, the original[^original] is deleted. Hence, the
problem of money on the internet: if I want to *move* ten bucks from my
computer to yours, the ten bucks are actually *copied* - bringing the
total balance up to twenty bucks during the transfer - and you have to
trust me that I will *destroy* my original ten bucks after you've
received the copy. Could you trust me to do that? This, in a nutshell,
is the *double-spending problem*. This conundrum is why most people
thought that the internet can't do money.

[^original]: Note that when dealing with pure information, it is a bit difficult to speak of "originals" and "copies" since information can be copied perfectly and physical location doesn't necessarily make sense.

### Money: Facilitating Trust

What do I mean when I say that the internet can't do money? After all,
there are credit cards, online banking, PayPal, Venmo, CashApp, AliPay,
WeChat Pay, and many other services that allow you to send and receive
money via the internet. However, they all have something in common: a
middleman - usually a company - is required to make them work. That's
because you need to *trust* someone to do the accounting right. All
because of that pesky double-spending problem! 

In the physical world, we don't have this problem. You give me an
apple. Now I have the apple, and you don't have the apple anymore.
There is no copying process, i.e., no duplication and subsequent
deletion. In the physical world, things move naturally from A to B
without getting copied. In the physical world, you don't need a
middleman to facilitate transactions.

In cyberspace, the only solution to this problem was having a middleman - a
trusted third party - manage the orderliness of transactions. Thus,
by default, PayPal, VISA, MasterCard (and all other companies that
process transactions) know exactly who paid what to whom at what point
in time and for what reason. Knowledge is power, and this particular
knowledge gives these trusted third parties the power to block
transactions, freeze accounts, decline payments, and de-platform their
customers. Further, as history has shown, this data will inevitably be
leaked either by negligence, incompetence, or targeted hacks.
[*Trusted Third Parties are Security Holes*][ttp], as Nick Szabo would say.

[ttp]: https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/

Bitcoin does away with all that, which is in part why it is so magical.
It behaves like real money in the real world: you hand me a dollar bill,
and that's it. The dollar bill doesn't have to pass through somebody
else to arrive at my hand. And why this dollar bill changed hands is
nobody's business but ours. We *can* tell others about it, but we are
not *forced* to do so, and most importantly: we don't have to ask for
permission to make this transaction. Bitcoin behaves in the same way:
you send me some sats, and that's it. Now I have those sats, and you
don't.

### Becoming a Bitcoin Wizard

Until very recently, you had to be a wizard to use Bitcoin. At least
that's what it felt like. Although Bitcoin came with a graphical user
interface from day one, understanding the arcane concepts that make it
work was (and still is!) like learning an ancient tongue. Private keys,
public keys, hashing functions, cryptographic signatures, elliptic
curves, remote procedure calls - for most people, there is simply no
difference between these concepts and glyphs describing a magic spell.

If you understand some of these concepts already, congratulations! You
have a head-start when it comes to understanding Bitcoin. However, the
technical side of Bitcoin is only one piece of the puzzle. Remember:
Bitcoin is magic internet *money*, first and foremost. Many
technology-minded people mistake it for a *technological* invention and
don't see the peculiar properties which make it an
astounding *monetary* innovation.

While using Bitcoin is getting easier every day, the days of the wizards
aren't numbered. To this day, Bitcoin experts discuss developments and
ideas in the #bitcoin-wizards[^irc] IRC channel, and
Bitcoin is still embraced and described as magic internet money. The
original wizard is evolving alongside Bitcoin, as is our idea of what a
Bitcoin wizard is. Today, it is probably fair to say that the real
wizards are the core developers, those who work on improvements at the
base layer of the Bitcoin protocol.

Understanding Bitcoin is a process, an individual journey. You might end
up becoming a bitcoin wizard yourself, just like the people that learned
to code[^raj] just to contribute to the Bitcoin project. And even if you don't,
I hope that these different ways of looking at Bitcoin will help you on your
journey of understanding Bitcoin a little better. At least, I hope that you will
shift your perspective on Bitcoin and what it is. While Bitcoin is and always
will be Magic Internet Money, it is so much more in its entirety.

[^raj]: My friend [Rajarshi Maitra](https://www.citadel21.com/from-hello-world-to-bitcoin-core), for example.

Many people who got sucked into the world of Bitcoin describe the
experience as "falling down the rabbit hole." Tipping your toes into
this strange world of keys and hashes does indeed feel a little bit like
entering Wonderland. Another metaphor that is often used is the "red
pill vs blue pill" scene from The Matrix, where Morpheus offers Neo a
red[^orangepill] pill (the truth) and a blue pill (ignorance, but bliss). Neo chooses
the red pill, and subsequently, he is bound to find out how deep the
rabbit hole goes.

[^orangepill]: In Bitcoin, the pill to swallow is *orange*, of course.

Similarly, I believe that the only way to understand Bitcoin's magical
properties is to experience it yourself. After you have set up
a non-custodial wallet and written down your seed phrase with
pen and paper, stop and realize that these words are the magic spell
that can move your bitcoin. For all intents and purposes, these words
are your bitcoin. Lose them, and they are gone. Memorize them, and you
have bitcoin in your head. Magical.

With great power comes great responsibility, as Uncle Ben taught us.
Bitcoin puts you in control, which, in turn, makes
you [responsible](https://dergigi.com/2021/03/14/the-responsibility-of-adopting-bitcoin/) for
your bitcoin. Once you get your hands on some sats, you can send them to
anyone anywhere, without asking for permission, without any sign-ups or
intermediaries. This, in turn, means that the onus is on you to be
diligent and cautious. If you lose access to your funds, there is nobody
to call. No one can help you to recover them. If you send funds to a
scam artist, nobody can reverse this transaction or reimburse you for
your gullibility.

This shift of trust and responsibility - from third parties to yourself -
is what allows for the emergence of sound money from the Bitcoin
network. But what differentiates sound money from an unsound one? And
why do we need sound money in the first place? Answering these questions
will be the focus of the [next chapter](https://21-ways.com).
