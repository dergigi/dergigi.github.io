title: Proof of Stake
subtitle: The failures of a centralized "consensus" mechanism
---

Proof-of-stake is no alternative to [proof-of-work][pow].
When deployed, proof-of-stake will run into failures in the long run, because it
has fundamentally flaws that can not be addressed without proof-of-work.

The fundamental flaws are:
- No trustless mechanism for [decentralized timestamping][time]
- No true randomness
- No truly fair validator selection
- No validator turnover
- No way to bootstrap & fairly distribute coins
- No real-world external cost
- No game-theoretic stability in an adversarial environment
- No way to reduce imbalance over time; rich get richer, always
- No aligned incentives

articles that explain why proof-of-stake is a non-solution to the problems that
Bitcoin solves. Also make sure to browse the [rekt leaderboard](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/) to get an idea of the amount of value destroyed and stolen by those who peddle bad ideas.
